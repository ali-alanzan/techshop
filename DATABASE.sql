I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Intro continues)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today we&#8217;re gonna spend a little time talking about WP Playground. This is a project that debuted at State of the Word in December 2022, but it was demoed for me about a month prior in November.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was, and remain, absolutely floored by the potential future applications, as well as the innovative thinking behind it. So I&#8217;ve invited a couple of excellent WordPress futurists to the show today so that we can listen in on their conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome guys.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Rich Tabor 00:01:07]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hey everyone, I&#8217;m Rich Tabor, and I&#8217;m here today with Adam Zielinski to talk about WordPress Playground. So for those of you who don&#8217;t know what WordPress Playground is, can you tell us a little bit more about it, Adam?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Zielinski 00:01:18]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Absolutely. WordPress Playground is WordPress that works in your browser like there&#8217;s no server with PHP or database like there&#8217;s just your browser and JavaScript, and you can run it in so many more places that we’ll all get to. For example, I just came back from WordCamp Gliwice, where on a Contributor Day, a couple of developers got set up with WordPress in just a couple of minutes, whereas normally, it can take hours to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Rich Tabor 00:01:44]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s pretty impressive. Do you think that, particularly for WordCamps and other demo-type areas, this would be something that&#8217;s very useful? Or what do you think would be the other problems that could be solved with WordPress Playground?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Zielinski 00:01:55]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Playground solves one primary problem, and that is WordPress is pretty difficult to get started with. I&#8217;m not even talking about creating your website, but let&#8217;s say, someone told you there&#8217;s this WordPress thing that you should try. Well, you Google for it, and you find installation instructions, and there&#8217;s like three hours of work for you there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So then maybe you&#8217;ll find a hosting company, and you have to pay some money. So with WordPress Playground, you can actually try it for free because there&#8217;s no cost to run it. It just runs on your device. If you&#8217;re a developer, and you want to start learning WordPress, normally you have to go through quite an extensive setup process, and there are some tools to make it easier, but maybe there&#8217;s still friction like you have to even own a computer, like a PC device or a Mac. Playground can run on your phone, and it can power interactive tutorials that you can use and just start learning there and there with zero setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like if you work on a product team and someone asks you to test a code change, with Playground you can just click a link and test it with no infrastructure behind it. And if you&#8217;re a company creating a plugin, you can just show your plugin in a live demo to people. And this isn&#8217;t something many plugins are doing because it&#8217;s quite hard to get a live demo set up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Rich Tabor 00:03:12]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ah, that&#8217;s pretty impressive. So, you know, amongst like tutorials, code changes for developer environments, the mobile application running, do you think that, since there&#8217;s such a wide brevity of ideas that WordPress Playground can kind of plug into, would this be more of a developer tool?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is that right? Or is Playground more of a like a click and play-type application that can run anywhere and demo anything?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Zielinski 00:03:36]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s both, but it&#8217;s more transparent for the users. So there are a whole lot of things you can do with Playground as a developer, as I just mentioned. But who are you doing these things for? Well, some of them are for the users, as in live demos, or there&#8217;s a WordCamp Europe coming, and I know some people are doing workshops there. They are going to use Playground to get everyone set up. So now that&#8217;s, well, maybe a workshop that teaches you how to build a theme, for example, right? Now you can just get started without any setup process. So there&#8217;s both, it&#8217;s very useful for development teams, and it&#8217;s very useful for them to build stuff for the final users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Rich Tabor 00:04:21]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s great. I know you, and I have probably both been in the same scenario at WordCamps when you&#8217;re trying to get dev environments set up, and it takes, you know, the better half of the workshop to get to step one. So this is really gonna be interesting to see it, especially at WordCamp Europe, and to see it getting into action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you planning on going to WordCamp Europe this year?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Zielinski 00:04:39]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Absolutely, I will have a table at Contributor Day, a WordPress Playground table. So yeah, everyone&#8217;s invited to come over. I&#8217;ll show you a lot of cool stuff. And then at WP Connect on Saturday at 10:00 AM, there will be a WordPress Playground session where you&#8217;ll be able to learn more and see some cool demos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this will be a conversational format, so we&#8217;ll just have a nice chat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Rich Tabor 00:05:01]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Super cool. So how else can people find out a little bit more info about Playground and perhaps even get involved and contribute to the project?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Zielinski 00:05:08]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a developer.WordPress.org/playground website. There&#8217;s a link in a show notes where you&#8217;ll be able, like this is the perfect entry point to the entire rabbit hole of WordPress Playground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a quite a few projects under the WordPress Playground umbrella, and they all live in a single GitHub repository where you can just find any issue that interests if you want to contribute and just start contributing. Also, there&#8217;s a Slack channel in WordPress org space called #meta-playground, and I highly encourage everyone interested in coming over to say hi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And probably one of the best places to ask questions and get acquainted with the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Rich Tabor 00:05:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, that&#8217;s great; I&#8217;m very intrigued about the project overall. I think that there&#8217;s an immense amount of potential, for WordPress Playground. Just last question here, like, where do you see the future of this project going? What is the most interesting application that hasn&#8217;t been done yet, or the things that are really gonna be the next level in unlocking Playground for everyone?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Zielinski 00:06:12]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s quite a few. Imagine being able to go to WordPress.org and have a WordPress demo right then and there without having to download anything. Then you customize it, and you have a button to host your website anywhere or just to download it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine having a live preview for all the themes and plugins in the directory and even in WordPress core, but these are sooner than later. Maybe like, let&#8217;s talk more grandiose, shall we? So there&#8217;s this term, 1 billion new users coming online in the next, like in the nearest future, and plenty of them doesn&#8217;t even own a desktop device. Maybe they have a mobile phone, maybe they have a tablet, maybe we&#8217;re talking about a young, prospective developer somewhere. And currently, if you don&#8217;t own a desktop device, you cannot contribute to the WordPress plugin ecosystem at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, we&#8217;re seeing more and more of creating themes with no code, which is really exciting. But you cannot build the plugin, really. Well, with WordPress Playground. Suddenly you can do development on a mobile device. So development tools and code editors and just the entire suite of things we use as the developers on our desktop of devices like this may come online and be available in your browser.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you&#8217;re on a train and you just have a phone with you, but you still want to learn, how to build a plugin, well, you&#8217;ll be able to do that. Furthermore, there&#8217;s a lot of exciting opportunities with ChatGPT, as in, well, here&#8217;s a WordPress running entirely on your device. So maybe if that&#8217;s connected to ChatGPT, you&#8217;ll be able to say, well, I like fish, or like, I want two columns and a photo of a racing car on top of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And because ChatGPT can output HTML, we connect the two, and suddenly, you can build a website entirely in your browser using natural language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Rich Tabor 00:08:20]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Man, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s really interesting. It really does unlock the next, potentially the next like, wave of innovation in the WordPress experience, especially removing all the complications of getting set up and actually seeing what&#8217;s there. I think that it really could, be huge for users every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Zielinski 00:08:38]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, here&#8217;s one more. So, edge computing is big lately, and it&#8217;s going to be bigger in the future. WordPress Playground runs on this new technology called Web Assembly, and it just happened so that a bunch of edge computing providers allows you to run web assembly on their gear. So imagine having WordPress running entirely in edge infrastructure with no centralized server.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Truly decentralized WordPress. It could be big for a well cost of operating, but also for speed, but also even further down in the future. Imagine downloading the actual, you know, even WordPress around time to your device and having the entire website on your phone. So then you know, you&#8217;re on a train, you enter a tunnel, but you can still browse that WooCommerce store and add things to your cart even though there is no range at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Rich Tabor 00:09:32]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wow, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s pretty crazy. How far out there do you think something like that is?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Zielinski 00:09:37]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to tell. I mean, technically, it is possible. There are a lot of challenges with regard to privacy, right? And data security for the edge computing case specifically. As for the development tools, there was a Cloud Fest hackathon earlier this year where I was with Daniel Bachhuber, also from Automattic, and we led this exciting project that brought the WordPress development environment into the browser using a couple of editors that are out there, and this is too much of an MVP for actual production use yet, but we got it working, and we build an actual plugin on a phone without internet access.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Rich Tabor 00:10:19]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wow. And that was just a hackathon, just hacking at it to see what you can get.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Zielinski 00:10:23]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, it was two and a half days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Rich Tabor 00:10:25]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, that&#8217;s awesome. That&#8217;s really cool, man. Well, this has been quite a pleasure. Thanks, Adam, for chatting all about WordPress Playground. Folks, just be sure to check out developer.WordPress.org/playground to explore, experiment, and play with WordPress Playground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has been awesome, Adam.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Zielinski 00:10:43]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you so much for having me, Rich.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:45]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What a remarkable new way of working with and experiencing WordPress. I would love to be able to find ways across the project and ecosystem to help folks see what they&#8217;re getting into before they get into it, but also, who knows what the future holds for that project. Keep an eye on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Musical interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:10]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us to our small list of big things happening right now in the WordPress project. The first one is that the Kim Parel Memorial Scholarship for WordCamp US 2023 is open, and applications for it are the WordPress Foundation will once again be offering that scholarship for Travel to WordCamp US.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is for specifically for women in technology, women in the WordPress space. I&#8217;ll include a link to that in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is WordPress&#8217; 20th anniversary is still coming, as we heard in the last podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have reached over 100 events that are scheduled on or around May 27th, which is WordPress’ launch date. There is still time to find your closest location and attend one of those events. And probably, there&#8217;s also time to pull together an event of your own. Head on over to wp20.WordPress.net if you would like to see events in your area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing is WordCamp US 2023. I realize WordCamp Europe comes before that, but the programming team actually has a really interesting thing that they&#8217;re doing this year. They have some changes to the way that they are organizing the event and finding speakers for the event. But as always, they are working very hard to make sure it is an attendee-focused event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m gonna include a link or two to some announcements that are really worthwhile there. Head on over to the podcast page to see those. And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Thanks again to my guests, and I&#8217;ll see y&#8217;all in a couple of weeks.&nbsp;</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"14968\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"WordPress 6.2.2 Security Release\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/05/wordpress-6-2-2-security-release/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 20 May 2023 04:09:39 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Security\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=14974\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:33:\"WordPress 6.2.2 is now available!\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19:\"Jonathan Desrosiers\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5451:\"\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WordPress 6.2.2 is now available!</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The 6.2.2 minor release addresses <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?milestone=6.2.2&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=status&amp;col=owner&amp;col=type&amp;col=priority&amp;col=milestone&amp;order=priority\">1 bug</a> and 1 security issue.

Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In case you hadn&#8217;t heard yet. WordPress is celebrating its 20th anniversary on May 27th.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a lot of celebrations and parties happening all across the world, hopefully with cake, because we all know that a party without cake is just a meeting and no one wants a year-long meeting about how old you are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:59]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you&#8217;ve not yet joined the celebrations, there&#8217;s still time to share your favorite WordPress merch, your favorite WordCamp memory, host a whole dang party if you want to, or share a video to post on wp20.wordpress.net. I&#8217;ve got links to everything you need in the show notes. So if you haven&#8217;t done it yet, you can do that while you listen to today&#8217;s episode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:14]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve got links to everything you need in the show notes. So if you haven&#8217;t done it yet, you can do that while you listen to today&#8217;s episode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:22]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, WordPress is the leading CMS in the market. And according to W3Tech&#8217;s it powers 43% of the web. And that&#8217;s like 35% of the top 10,000 sites that are built using this software. And sometimes, that&#8217;s as a website, sometimes as a framework, but always as a way for people and businesses to find a space on the web to call their own.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:45]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021. The first-ever study on the WordPress ecosystem gave us an idea of just how large our ecosystem is. We already kind of had a sense that millions of people make a living through WordPress because we know that we are supporting small business owners and freelancers all the way out to agencies and content creators.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:06]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But according to that study, WordPress at the time was powering 82 million websites and enabled an estimated economy of $597 billion. The success of an economy like this and various other alternative economies hinges on the success of invisible open source software that powers the web, just like WordPress, that has a tonne of growth and a lot of wins since that first Cafe Log fork way back in 2003.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:37]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And WordPress could just say pencils down, everybody. Good job, team, and just kind of watch what comes next. But I&#8217;ve never met a word processor, emboldened as we are by our belief in open source freedoms, who stepped away from a challenge worth facing the recognition that everyone should have those freedoms whether they know they exist or not. Because I know that no one cares as much about open source freedoms as open source maintainers. But the recognition that everyone has the right to them anyway is built into the foundations of what WordPress is and who WordPress is.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:13]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are big plans for WordPress future, many of which are grounded in the promise of a new block editor within WordPress that aims to lower the barriers to entry for people at any point in their learning curve. So let&#8217;s take a look at what this means for WordPress, the software, and follow up about what it means for the WordPress community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:31]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, the software right at the end of 2018, the Gutenberg editor was merged into WordPress Core. And it&#8217;s subverted the way that people had always managed their content. It brought with it this new concept of site building that focused on blocks as the primary mode of creation. It was modular and required very little code knowledge.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:53]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arguably also very little skill with design. Although if you&#8217;ve ever seen me tried to design something with blocks, you will know it takes some skill. But still, the ultimate goal was to make those fundamental user interactions of managing the block and apply them in any place you could manage your site using WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:53]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you think about the possibility to create media-rich content without having to work with shortcode, without having to know HTML workarounds, it opens the opportunity for many of us in the WordPress community to own our digital presence. In case it wasn&#8217;t already clear, this, my friends, is an audacious project, and it&#8217;s even more so if you remember that we have this existing and massive ecosystem that is enabled and empowered by our software.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:42]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as we look forward to the third phase of the Gutenberg Project, collaborative editing inside a WordPress installation will soon be a reality, which if you are like me and you never work on a website alone, you&#8217;re probably just dying to have. I say all this not to toot the horn have WordPress or belabor our success but rather to emphasize the importance of what I&#8217;m going to say next, which is how this CMS got to where it is, namely through the work of the community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:12]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has survived, and I would dare to say thrived through decades of constant economic, cultural, and technological shifts. And I believe that the thing that keeps us innovating fast enough to stay relevant but slow enough to be ethical, is how the community actively engages with the open source project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:32]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know that our strength is directly tied to the resilience of our contributors. And we know that the software we ship is shaped by the people who are willing to tell us what they love, what they hate, and what they hope to see. When the WordPress project started, we mainly had code contributions as a way to give back, but over time, the project has grown to include contributions to learning, community building, and translations, among other things, but all of that exists alongside the CMS-focused contributions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:03]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because WordPress as an organization understands that it is an integral part of an ecosystem of 1000s of global companies and millions of individual people who are building careers, starting businesses, learning new skills, and becoming part of something meaningful. I know that I talk just all the time about the greatness of WordPress as a software and community, which makes sense.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:29]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really do love the work I do with you all. But I am equally in awe of this open-hearted journey of disruption that WordPress represents as an open source project. WordPress and its community is part of a long line of disruptors; blogs made publishing available to everyone, which maybe doesn&#8217;t sound like a big deal right now because you&#8217;ve been around blogging forever.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:51]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ve been able to just put your thoughts on the internet with almost no effort for as long as you have known the internet existed, but WordPress, at the time, was and honestly remains the low code open source CMS of choice. It has been for years. And so, let me backtrack you through the 10,000-foot milestones of our journey here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:14]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg has been around since 2013. It&#8217;s 10 years. I know, don&#8217;t get scared, we&#8217;re celebrating 20 years. So it&#8217;s been around for half of our time as a concept. Open source as a concept was formalized in the 1980s. Though it definitely has been around longer than that as a concept and a way of working.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:34]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this low-code, no-code movement that we hear about from time to time that has been around since the 1970s, and just because we first became aware of it in the 1970s doesn&#8217;t mean that that&#8217;s when it actually first was discussed or thought about or used. Which means that you are in this moment, decades deep into projects that changed our entire understanding of the web.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:59]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So grab a slice of cake, and raise a glass to 20 great years of WordPress, and I am going to raise a glass to 20 more years of continuing our journey together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:17]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us effervescently to the small list of big things. Yeah, I said effervescently.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:24]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are a lot of things happening in the WordPress project over the next couple of weeks. There is a lot of testing going on. There are a lot of releases that are getting underway. There are events and things. So here&#8217;s my rundown of stuff you should take a look at.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:38]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So firstly, there is a post out about performance improvements from 6.2. That is just inviting an open discussion so that we can get more of those improvements in better shape to get into the 6.3 release. And speaking of the 6.3 release that is coming, just last week, we announced the release squad that we have.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:58]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is an extra heavy release squad because we also are working toward the 6.4 release just at the same time. So there&#8217;s the folks who are running the 6.3 release, and they have committed to working openly and in public channels as much as possible so that the 6.4 folks have a chance to really take a look at what goes into a release, the questions that we ask, the philosophies we believe in, and then that 6.4 release oil pick up probably, my guess is August-ish, mid-August or so.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:32]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That 6.4 release is specifically going to be made up entirely of diverse genders. People that we historically see are underrepresented in technology, but as always, we accept contributions from everyone for all releases.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:48]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third thing is that we have WordCamp Europe coming up, that is June 8 and 10th. So a little bit past the two-week mark.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:54]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there is a final call for volunteers for anyone who wants to be able to help at the event. I personally have always enjoyed doing that kind of volunteer work. It helps you get to know your community even a bit better. And I don&#8217;t know; I&#8217;m just kind of an extroverted people person. So, of course, I always want to volunteer, but that call is still open. And they&#8217;re in the last phases of that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:17]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also a team or two that needs some help with getting leads for the contributor day that happens leading up to WordCamp. Europe, I know that the testing team needs a lead for the table, and so if you enjoy the process of triaging or testing or helping people get their environment set up, that is a great opportunity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:37]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the final thing on my small, my big small list of big things is that we have a kind of a review of the currently defined contributor ladder for the Polyglots team. There are a number of posts over the years where we talk about the ways that people move through being a contributor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:57]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that we know about almost all contributor ladders is that there&#8217;s no time requirement between the steps, but in general, it functions like a ladder. So you do have to have, like, rung one. And then, rung two, if you try to skip from rung one to rung three, you will have a lot of difficulty.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:17]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not impossible, but it&#8217;s harder than going 1, 2, 3 In the normal sequential order. And so that&#8217;s a whole discussion that&#8217;s happening over there.

For 2022, the survey received a comprehensive update, the first in six years. The total number of questions was reduced to 29 from nearly 100, socio-economic questions were mostly removed, and the Likert scale was introduced. These updates were intended to increase the completion rate of the survey, enable a more efficient and structured analysis of these data, and position the survey to best gauge the topics that matter most to the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My goal is that the input received via the survey helps inform initiatives and focus areas for WordPress in the near term, along with other signals, such as conversations in the community, the Making WordPress blogs, and events. Such data play a key role in shaping the direction and strategy of the project and measuring progress in focus areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">2022 Highlights</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>The 2022 edition of the survey experienced a 26% increase in completion rate, however, submissions decreased by 56% to roughly 3400, including about 800 contributors. For the 2023 survey, promotion will be increased, hopefully counteracting the declining submissions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here are some key takeaways:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>The survey shows an increased usage of blocks and the new site editor (versus the classic editor), which shouldn’t come as a surprise since the default theme is now a block theme.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>22% of respondents have only used WordPress for a year or less. Those responding to the survey are also getting a bit older, with fewer responses from those under 40 than in prior years.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>1 in 5 respondents learned about WordPress from a coworker, and about the same percentage from using a search engine.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>In 2022, WordPressers continued to learn about WordPress (68%), taught others about WP (48%), and built sites for others (55%).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>WordPressers choose the CMS platform because it’s open source (62%), flexible (47%), low risk (45%), cost-effective (45%), and has a positive reputation (41%).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>57% of survey participants obtained news and training directly from <a href=\"http://wordpress.org\">WordPress.org</a>. While that is the primary source, other sites remain very important: search engines (46%), YouTube (40%), other WordPress communities (35%), and social media (30%)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The overwhelming majority of respondents don’t regularly use other CMS platforms, and 21% of respondents use none of the top 20 WordPress plugins.&nbsp;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Respondents continue to state that “WordPress is as good as or better than other CMS platforms,” with 68% agreeing. Elements that respondents feel are the best aspects of WordPress include “ease of use,” “flexibility,” and/or “plugin options,” all about 30% each. When asked about the most frustrating elements of WordPress, 1 in 5 said, “nothing,” while approximately 30% referenced difficulties with site editing / Gutenberg.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The overall contributor experience remains positive and something I continue to care about deeply. 64% shared they had a positive experience, and 24% viewed their experience as “neutral.” Contributors also feel welcome at the same percentages (64% agree and 24% are neutral).</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h1 class=\"wp-block-heading\">What’s Planned for 2023</h1>\n\n\n\n<p>In the next iteration of the survey, the plan is to improve the language options for completing the survey and continue investing in refining the questions and how they are asked. It is important to be mindful that completing a survey takes time, so we want to make sure community members are being asked questions that help WordPress the most.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The tentative plan is to launch the 2023 edition in August. This will set up an opportunity for the 2023 results and, most importantly, your input to inform planning for 2024’s key initiatives and focus areas. The community’s feedback is vitally important to the success and direction of the project. Moving the survey to earlier in the year can positively affect planning and dialogue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/files/2023/05/2022-Annual-Survey-Final.pdf\">View the 2022 Slide Deck</a></p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p><em>Big thank you to <a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/dansoschin/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>dansoschin</a> for the analysis and editorial support.

At that time, she recalls, there was some resistance to girls&#8217; education in certain subjects. Thanks to her parents&#8217; support and encouragement, she graduated in Computer Science Engineering. Following graduation, she went on to work for an international firm. However, she felt she wanted to work in her home area and so returned to work for a firm based in Udaipur itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Monika started her career journey with WordPress in 2015, and was fascinated as she learnt more of the technology. A few years later, she moved into a&nbsp; role as a WordPress Quality Analyst, enabling her to dive further into the software. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>“From that moment, I decided to make it an integral part of my ever-learning professional career,” she said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The more Monika researched WordPress, the more she found it was not just a tool to simplify website building but also a platform where you could “meet new people, share your thoughts, learn from them and improve yourself through the process.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When she first started working with WordPress, she found she had many questions, ranging from what are themes and plugins to what is a WordCamp. As her knowledge grew, she knew one day she wanted to be able to contribute to both the code and the community supporting it.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Becoming part of WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Monika started contributing to WordPress in 2015 with Theme Review. In this area, she was able to work alongside WordPress code experts and, at the same time, learn the concepts of theme development. She saw this as a great opportunity to learn and improve her development skills.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She was also very interested in testing from the beginning, so she started contributing to Core. Her first contribution was to the WordPress 4.7 release in 2016. She remembers the day she first saw her name in the WordPress contributor list. This encouraged her to make more contributions including to core and the community team, and each time she felt more like part of the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thus inspired, Monika delved into making the software more easily available in her native Hindi language through joining other contributors to the Polyglots team. She went on to become a General Translation Editor for the Hindi language, and has continued to contribute in this area.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" width=\"902\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/04/wp-udaipur-2017.png?resize=902%2C600&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Monika as part of a panel at WordCamp Udaipur 2017\" class=\"wp-image-14846\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/04/wp-udaipur-2017.png?w=902&amp;ssl=1 902w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/04/wp-udaipur-2017.png?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/04/wp-udaipur-2017.png?resize=768%2C511&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 902px) 100vw, 902px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Monika and other panelists at WordCamp Udaipur 2017</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As she became involved with the WordPress community, she looked for ways of sharing it with others in her home city. In 2017 she was part of the organizing team for <a href=\"https://udaipur.wordcamp.org/2017\">WordCamp Udaipur 2017</a> and there shared her contributing journey with others. This was her first WordCamp, and she describes the experience as ‘superb’. It enabled her to connect to both those new to WordPress and those already working with it. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>“It was a great moment for me speaking in front of hundreds of people and everyone cherished my journey. It inspired me to continue my contribution to other teams too.” </p>\n<cite>Monika Rao</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>She went on to be an organizer for <a href=\"https://udaipur.wordcamp.org/2018/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://udaipur.wordcamp.org/2018/\">WordCamp Udaipur 2018</a> and <a href=\"https://india.wordcamp.org/2021/\">WordCamp India 2021</a>. She also contributes to the Meta and Theme review teams. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Contributing to WordPress software releases</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>2019 was a big year for Monika. She got married and joined a new firm where she could work more on WordPress, learning about marketing and design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In November 2019, the WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden put out a call for an all-women and non-binary release squad. Monika said: “I’ve always felt that not enough women take part in WordPress, so I decided to jump in.” She took on the role of Test Lead.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>“It was a wonderful journey— worth every second and this was a proud moment for me when I saw my name on the WordPress Noteworthy list. You feel proud when you see your small contributions in use by 40 per cent of the web.”</p>\n<cite>Monika Rao</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"660\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/04/monika-5-6.jpg?resize=1024%2C660&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Some of the notable contributors for the WordPress 5.6 release\" class=\"wp-image-14849\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/04/monika-5-6.jpg?resize=1024%2C660&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/04/monika-5-6.jpg?resize=300%2C193&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/04/monika-5-6.jpg?resize=768%2C495&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2023/04/monika-5-6.jpg?w=1319&amp;ssl=1 1319w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Monika was part of the notable contributors for the WordPress 5.6 release</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As a Test Lead, her priority was ensuring the release would be stable and, more importantly, ready for production sites. To effectively manage all the testing, test scrubs were run weekly, highlighting the key testing areas to help get the entire team involved. The scrubs also played an important role in picking up tickets needing immediate resolution.<br><br>Monika also continued her role in the WordPress 5.7 release, and focused more on the core software. She believes being part of the Core and Test teams is a good way to watch and learn, as well as take part in the different elements that make up a release.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>“Skills you have will eventually fade away unless you work on them and sharpen them. So don’t underestimate the value of any skill. It will eventually help you somehow in your career.”</p>\n<cite>Monika Rao</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>She added: &#8220;I owe my skills and knowledge to WordPress and its lovely community. The best part about this platform is that it is free and provides ample opportunities to improve your skills and build a career. The wider WordPress community is highly supportive, and it provides numerous additional resources, such as online forums, tutorials, and meetups, to help people learn and grow.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing: the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open<strong> </strong>source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40] Start of Show</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just over 50 episodes ago, I shared some basic thoughts about the four freedoms of open source. I also talked through the most quoted phrase in open source&nbsp; “free as in free speech, not free as in beer.” And honestly, what podcast about the freedoms of open source would be complete without that? If you haven&#8217;t listened to that episode, I suggest you do, but if you don&#8217;t have time, I&#8217;ll start by reminding us all of the definition of free software, which is most commonly referred to as the four freedoms of open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:12]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first thing is the freedom to run the program as you wish for any purpose. The second thing is the freedom to study how the program works and to change it so that it does your computing as you wish. As a side note, access to the source code is a precondition for this.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third freedom is the freedom to redistribute copies so that you can help others. And the fourth freedom is the freedom to distribute copies of your modified versions to others. By doing this, you can give the whole community a chance to benefit from your changes, and of course, also access to the source code is a precondition for this.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:47]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The TLDR version of these freedoms is, essentially, that users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change, and improve the software. Now, normally when I speak about the freedoms of open source, I&#8217;m talking about it either from a practical or a philosophical standpoint, but I also spend a lot of time thinking about it from a leadership and organizational perspective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every once in a while, you might hear me talk about the effects of “open source at scale,” or you might hear Matt say that the four freedoms are essentially the “Bill of Rghts for the open web.” I almost never really dig into either of those topics because it&#8217;s just really complicated. But for starters, anytime you talk about what someone is entitled to or deserves or expects, there is a feeling of political bias.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:40]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while I personally believe that creating software is inherently political or, at a minimum, concerned with the needs of people, that&#8217;s not what convinces anyone to participate in open source, and it&#8217;s certainly not what convinces people to use WordPress. But here&#8217;s the thing, as a leader in a widely used, free, and open source software project, as a leader in WordPress, I also know that every new user to our platform or any other open source platform represents a little more freedom in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A little more access to tools and jobs that weren&#8217;t available before. A slightly more open door to networks that undergird the success of entrepreneurs across the globe and a little more equity to the world of democratizing publishing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:28]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I look at the four freedoms of open source, this Bill of Rights for the Web, I see not only the freedoms that we should have but also the things that we should have freedom from.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We should have the freedom to know how our tools work, the freedom to know what information they need from us, and also the freedom to have some way to make that software work specifically for us because that&#8217;s why we have software because we have humans that need it. But we should also have freedom from having to hide our hacky enhancements or freedom from fear of losing our earned audience, or even the fear of losing access to copious amounts of content that we have created ourselves over the years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:13]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And honestly, the things that we should be free from just include a lot of fear of loss. Loss of opportunity or relevance or livelihood. And I feel like for our project, and maybe for open source as a whole, we&#8217;re encountering a lot of that right now, whether we are aware of it or not. We&#8217;re seeing advancements like GPT3 or ChatGPT if that sounds more familiar and co-pilot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And while it&#8217;s not quite in the same vein, also things like Gutenberg. Advancements that are coming to technology around us, technology we&#8217;re familiar with. And it&#8217;s hard to see what&#8217;s in them sometimes. It&#8217;s hard to see what drives them. It&#8217;s hard to know how we can make them work for us. So I have to remind us all, as citizens of an open source community, that what protects us from those things we should be free from is directly connected to how active we are in the things we are free to.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We hear that in a slightly more routine way from folks around open source communities. Basically, the whole concept of open source software is being built by the folks who show up. You can&#8217;t influence the future of anything if you&#8217;re not showing up in the spaces where the influence happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:35]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So be an active participant in these new technologies. Learn how GPT works and how it could work for you, even if it&#8217;s just writing better prompts. Learn how Gutenberg can support your needs, not subvert your needs, even if it&#8217;s just learning how to arrange a series of blocks into a pattern or patterns into a page.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But as with all fast-moving technological advances, I encourage you to leap in feet first, not head first. Get in up to your neck in the &#8220;why&#8221;s and &#8220;how&#8221;s of that new technology you&#8217;ve been worrying about. Be the first to become best at this arcane new thing because that&#8217;s why we open source at all so that you have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change, and improve your software.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:33] Small List of Big Things</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings me now to my small list of big things. It&#8217;s a very small list, but it is very big, as always. The first thing is that we are gearing up for the remaining major releases of the year, WP 6.3 and 6.4 in an atypical moment for our project. You can volunteer for both simultaneously if you want, and hopefully, you do want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second thing is that there are many ways to celebrate WordPress&#8217;s 20th anniversary on May 27th. But one of the things you can do right now is record a short video or sound clip about a great memory or experience you have had in this community or just generally because of WordPress. Those will be featured on the WP 20 website, and maybe even a lucky few will make it into the second volume of the WordPress history book.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thanks for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing.

Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:28]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The latest version of WordPress has shipped. WordPress 6.2, which was named after Eric Dolphy, was released on March 29th. And as is the way with software, there&#8217;s already a minor release underway to catch a few errant issues that folks like you have reported to us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a big release that refines a lot of our design tools, but some of the most important changes are actually to the inserter. If you haven&#8217;t had a chance to get in there and play with it yet, here are the three things that I think you should know. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:08] </p>\n\n\n\n<p>First, the pattern browser. We&#8217;re all aware of the block inserter by now, and a lot of us probably use the quick options, the keyboard shortcuts, or that kind of inline inserter, that little black box that&#8217;s in the middle of your post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you use the main inserter, that&#8217;s a blue square in the top left of the screen. If you use that to add a block, you can still add individual blocks as usual. But there&#8217;s a new way to browse patterns, and in my opinion, it is so much better. It now brings out this drawer that has like thumbnails of patterns that will work with your theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you, like me, know what you want your site to look like, but could not in a million years figure out how to build it from scratch out of individual blocks, then this is the area for you. It was like shopping, but you don&#8217;t have to go through a checkout process at the end, and you still have what you want. It&#8217;s great.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:00]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s also available when you&#8217;re working on templates or template parts, so you can make changes everywhere instead of going page by page. The second thing that I think you should know is about the media browser in that same area where you browse your patterns; you can also now browse for media.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It lets you look through the images you&#8217;ve already added to your site, but it also lets you search for openly licensed images from Openverse. And if you choose one of those images from Openverse, it inserts the proper attribution for you. You still have to add your own alt text, but that&#8217;s the fun part anyway, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:35]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And number three, a Style Book. So this thing is available in the template editing area, specifically, as is appropriate, given what it actually does. So if you&#8217;re in the template area, toward the top right of the screen is like a half moon day mode, night mode looking icon. If you click on that, you can make changes to things inside your blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you click on the little eyeball icon that&#8217;s just underneath it, it pulls up a style book where you can also see and edit the styles globally. If that didn&#8217;t make sense to you, don&#8217;t worry. I&#8217;ve got you. I&#8217;m about to tell you a bunch of things you can do in here. You can edit the way headings and lists and tables, quotes, and code looks all across the site. You can edit the way images, galleries, files, and videos look using custom CSS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. Also, all across the site. And you can edit buttons, separators, and individual blocks. Say it with me &#8212; all across the site. That is not a comprehensive list. There is a ton of stuff. You can see the styles that you have applied across the whole site. You can see them in context, and you can make any changes that you need globally, which means all across the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Style Books. What will we think of next? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:54]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So those are my three things I think you should know about WordPress right now. As a former WordPress builder who was never really super great with the code, this stuff makes me feel powerful. I just love these changes, and I hope you do too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> [00:04:07]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us now to our small list of big things. First, we just launched the Developer Blog. It&#8217;s over at developer.wordpress.org/news. It has a bunch of content on it that not only is geared specifically toward developers that are using WordPress but especially the folks who are extending WordPress. It gives you kind of an in-depth look at various changes and projects, and implementations and what goes into each one of them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it gives you a bit of like this aspirational overview of stuff that you could do with WordPress and then also gives you an inside look at how you would accomplish it yourself. It&#8217;s very cool. I like it a lot. Head on over there, but we&#8217;ll have a link to the show notes below.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:00]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that we have an MVP of our new mentorship program that is underway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It should be debuting for essentially testing any day now, a link to the posts detailing that work, just in case you want to join that important initiative. But it is an important thing for me. I think that mentorship is a key element of many of our successful contributors&#8217; onboarding journeys, a part of their story of coming to us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, creating a mentorship program that is a bit sustainable and looks toward the health of the overall project, I think, is an excellent plan.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:38]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third thing on our small list of big things is that Matt put out a nice little post about kind of the history of why jazz has this strong background in the WordPress project. It&#8217;s a brief read. I&#8217;ll put a link to that in the show notes as well. But suffice it to say that he&#8217;s saying that jazz has a little bit of learned processes and rules but that the primary expectation is that you&#8217;re able to make of the jazz what you want. Like you get to make your own thing out of it. You get to be extemporaneous. You get to be very measured, whatever it is, that expresses what you are trying to do and what you are trying to say with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s why he feels like jazz is such an important part of the DNA of the WordPress project. Like I said, it&#8217;s a short read. I&#8217;ll put a link to it in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:30]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, there are a few working groups that folks can contribute to right now. We don&#8217;t always have working groups. We generally just kind of do stuff inside individual teams. But right now, we&#8217;ve got like the kids camp group, the sustainability group, and of course, that mentorship working group that I mentioned earlier in our list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you&#8217;re wanting a little change of pace, I&#8217;d drop by their areas in the Making WordPress Slack to see if they have anything that&#8217;s up your alley. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"14818\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:37:\"The Month in WordPress – March 2023\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/04/the-month-in-wordpress-march-2023/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 03 Apr 2023 10:30:57 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Month in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"month in wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=14780\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:383:\"March saw the arrival of the first major release of 2023, WordPress 6.2 “Dolphy.” Planning for the project&#8217;s 20th anniversary continues with new celebratory updates and commemorative swag.

MariaDB is a popular open source database used by those looking to further scale their websites, as it is generally faster than MySQL with better support for a concurrent number of connections. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;At the moment it appears WordPress is dominating the PHP world, so this seemed to be the perfect target,&#8221; MariaDB Foundation Chief Contributions Officer Andrew Hutchings <a href=\"https://mariadb.org/mariadb-foundation-at-cloudfest-hackathon/\">said</a> about creating the plugin at the hackathon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p> &#8220;The MariaDB Foundation loves WordPress (I’m writing this post in WordPress right now) so it seemed like a logical project.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin helps users debug their MariaDB databases by displaying important information, such as logs, locale, connections, character set and collation, and options. It also shows a graph of the number of queries and the execution time over the last 24 hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin also integrates with WordPress&#8217; Site Health feature with two checks:  an end-of-life check and a check for whether Histograms have been run. Histograms are an optimizer that can help improve MariaDB performance, and the plugin enables calculation of histograms to run on WordPress tables with the click of a button under the plugin&#8217;s Tools menu.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There are a few features now and it is a good framework to add more features to in future,&#8221; Hutchings said. &#8220;This is a community project and is open to suggestions and pull requests. This is a project that we at the MariaDB Foundation want to support in the future.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MariaDB Health Checks is <a href=\"https://github.com/MariaDB/wordpress-mariadb-health-checks\">developed on GitHub</a> where developers can follow the plugin&#8217;s progress, contribute to new features, and report bugs.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 24 May 2023 21:14:56 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:122:\"Post Status: WP 6.2.2 • WP Playground • Client-side Filtering • Future WordCamp Brainstorms • Plugin Review Update\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=149407\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:117:\"https://poststatus.com/wp-6-2-2-wp-playground-client-side-filtering-future-wordcamp-brainstorms-plugin-review-update/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:21112:\"<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-this-week-at-wordpress-org-april-3-2023\">This Week at WordPress.org (May 22, 2023)</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"has-background has-theme-palette-8-background-color wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">WordPress 6.2.2 is available now for update.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox has a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes and in this case, how you can start to make your sites more interactive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast, player of choice, or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you, and hopefully get you or your idea featured on the show. Head to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Mario Santos and Luis Herranz. They both work for Automattic but are sponsored to work full-time in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main focus of their work is the block developer experience, and they are part of the group of contributors that worked on the Interactivity API proposal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Interactivity API is the main focus of the podcast today, and if you&#8217;re working with blocks and dynamically displaying data, this is sure to be of interest to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We start out the podcast today with the usual introductions, and get to know Mario and Luis. And then we learn what the Interactivity API is and what it can do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conversation is framed around a blog post written by Mario entitled, The interactivity API, a better developer experience in building interactive blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this Mario shows examples of what website interactivity is. In short, it&#8217;s the ability for content to be amended on the fly without a page refresh. Of course, this is nothing new on the web. We&#8217;ve been seeing this for years in WordPress sites and elsewhere. But now you&#8217;re going to be able to create interactivity in a standard way across the different blocks on your site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project hopes to absorb complexity and make the creation of interactive objects fairly trivial. Mario and Luis talk about examples of where the API might be used, and how it can be implemented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also discussed the fact that in the past developers have gone their own way to make their sites interactive. It all works, but it means that no two implementations are the same. This causes issues if the project is taken over by another developer. But it&#8217;s also a drain on resources.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mario and Luis make the point that having a standard way of creating interactivity will benefit everyone in the long run. We get into the weeds a little and talk about the approach the team took when building the API. They decided to use directives and we find out why this was, and what benefit it brings over other possible solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project is still experimental, and they&#8217;re looking for people to test and report back on what they find to move the interactivity API forwards.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to. WPTavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Mario Santos and Luis Herranz.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Luis Herranz and Mario Santos. Hello.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:15] Luis Herranz: Hey, hello Nathan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:16] Mario Santos: Thanks for inviting us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:18] Nathan Wrigley: You&#8217;re so welcome. We had an introduction on Slack from Anne McCarthy, who listeners to the podcast may very well have heard of, and she wanted me to chat to these two about the Interactivity API, so we&#8217;re going to get onto that. It&#8217;s a brand new project. Could be very interesting if you&#8217;re a developer implementing it, but also if you&#8217;re an implementer of WordPress websites and not a developer, you&#8217;ll be interested in the outcomes of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we do that, the usual questions at the beginning. I&#8217;m going to go to Luis first, if that&#8217;s all right. Would you mind just giving us your backstory, how you&#8217;ve come to be on a WordPress podcast, how long you&#8217;ve been working with WordPress, who you work for as much or as little as you wish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:57] Luis Herranz: Okay, thank you. I started creating websites with WordPress 2010, I think, maybe nine, I don&#8217;t know, a long time ago. And I wanted to start a company in 2013, with Pablo Postigo. And we thought, okay, we wanted to create native apps for different companies, like services and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we knew WordPress, so we basically started with what was later known as headless WordPress, but back in 2013. And since then we iterated, we created a team. We got some investment and we started doing things on top of WordPress. Mostly in headless. First with native applications. Then we moved to just web have applications, but still on headless. Very focused on React.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in 2019 we launched a open source framework for headless WordPress, powered by React. So we were very focused on developer experience and performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in 2021, that company, Frontity was acquired by Automattic, so we could become like full-time contributors and focus on, well, basically what the Interactivity API proposal is today. Bringing some of those user experiences, what are possible with other solutions, to WordPress itself, on top of full site editing, or block themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:31] Nathan Wrigley: Thank you so much. That&#8217;s really interesting. I appreciate your nice history there. Thank you. And we&#8217;ll ask the same question this time of Mario. So Mario, backstory please.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:41] Mario Santos: Thank you. Actually, my story is really similar to Luis. Well first, when I finished the degree, I studied industrial engineer, but I didn&#8217;t want to be an engineer. So I started trying different things, and while I got my first job, I created a store in WordPress with WooCommerce. And then, that is when I started to learn about WordPress and all those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And later, based on that, I joined Frontity. I don&#8217;t remember exactly the year, 2015 maybe. And from there I really learned what was WordPress because we started going to meetups to WordCamps, and we started to, well at least I started to learn from the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From there the story is mostly the same as Luis. We were working on headless mainly. We were working with WordPress. And at some point, we were acquired by Automattic, and now I&#8217;m a sponsored contributor, working full-time. And as Luis said, we are focused on the developer experience, and the Interactivity API that we are going to talk about is part of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:45] Nathan Wrigley: Thank you so much for that. So the Interactivity API, I&#8217;m going to link in the show notes to a post which you can find. Now the post you&#8217;re going to be looking at is on the make.wordpress.org website. It&#8217;s written by Mario. It was on the 30th of March, 2023 that came out, and it&#8217;s entitled, Proposal, The Interactivity API, A Better Developer Experience in Building Interactive Blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, if at any point during this podcast you become a little bit confused or you wish to have some more background, I would recommend pausing and going and reading what is an incredibly lengthy and detailed post, with actually a boatload of interaction and comments as well. It&#8217;s really heartening to see so many people chipping in, and giving their thoughts on this Interactivity API.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I guess the best place to kick this conversation off simply asking, what is it? What is the Interactivity API? What does it do? Why does WordPress need such a thing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:47] Mario Santos: I can start with this one. So, the Interactivity API is what we are proposing. The group of contributors that are working on that. It&#8217;s basically a new standard system to easily add front end interactivity to your blocks. Until now, most of the Gutenberg APIs have been focused on the block editor side, and there was unintentional gap on the front end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So block developers could choose whatever they want. They could choose any Javascript framework, or other solutions. And the Interactivity API aims to cover that gap. Creating this standard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So imagine functionalities like, like this post or e-commerce functionalities like add to cart, or the checkout, the instant search, page transitions, the comments form, without a page reload. So those are the user experiences that the Interactivity API aims to cover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a way that is real easy to build them, and block developers don&#8217;t have to deal with complex scaffolding or external tools. And it&#8217;s important to note also that it&#8217;s completely familiar and compatible with PHP and the block ecosystem. So overall, that&#8217;s what the Interactivity API is. Basically a standard to easily create any interactive experience that your users want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:06] Nathan Wrigley: Luis, anything to add?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:09] Luis Herranz: No, it&#8217;s really filling that gap, or even that opportunity of absorbing as much complexity from the developers. Standardizing everything in a single solution, and making sure that it&#8217;s performant, and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, there&#8217;s some advancement in web development in other places, mostly in the Javascript ecosystem and WordPress has never been opinionated in the front end, so this is kind of the first time for WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yeah, we think that it&#8217;s an opportunity as well to absorb a lot of complexity for the developers, and to enable some of the user experiences that were not possible with WordPress before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:52] Nathan Wrigley: Now we have some show notes, and we&#8217;ve got a list of questions that we&#8217;re potentially going to run through, but I&#8217;m going to skip to the end, more or less of the list of our questions. Because one of the things I think to do at the beginning would be to provide listeners concrete examples of how this might be used.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So do you have any examples that you think would demonstrate clearly the kind of things that the Interactivity API is touching on? I&#8217;ll just mention one. Which is the very first thing you&#8217;re going to see more or less when you open up Mario&#8217;s article, and it&#8217;s a video. It&#8217;s pretty short, two minutes long. And it demonstrates something a little bit like Netflix, where you&#8217;ve got, a view of three or four different video thumbnails. There&#8217;s a bunch of different movies there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the intention is that you would like to preserve your favorites. And so there&#8217;s a little heart icon, which is lodged in the top left of the thumbnails for each video. And as you click on that thumbnail, the heart becomes colored in. It goes from gray to red. But also in a different part of the UI, in the right hand of the view, the menu, traditional place for the menu, there&#8217;s a little total which goes up from two to three to four, and if you remove the hearts, it goes back down to two and so on and so forth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s one example of how you might use this. It&#8217;s able to do things on the page without needing to do page refreshes. And the idea is that this will be a standard way of doing it in blocks. And I wonder if you could give us some other examples. You mentioned WooCommerce and things like that. But let&#8217;s go into that a little bit. Some examples of where this might be useful for developers and end users to know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:35] Mario Santos: Yeah, so basically the use case is anything that is interactive and requires Javascript should be able to be done with the Interactivity API in an easy way. So imagine like a slide show or light boxes in the image. So when you click on it, it zooms, and when you click out or scroll, it goes out. Some models like search, subscription, quizzes, e-commerce integrations, like you just have mentioned.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one of the features that is enabled by having a standard is the client site navigation that basically is navigating through different pages of your WordPress site without triggering a page reload.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to know that this is something that is going to be enabled by the Interactivity API, but it&#8217;s going to be completely optional. So if you don&#8217;t need it, you don&#8217;t have to use it. But it powers other features like you can see in the movie, that we are paginating between the different pages. We are in the query loop. You have the pagination block, and you can go through the page one to the page two without page reload.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for example, well, in the movies demo, we are showing that you can play the trailer and you can keep navigating and the video doesn&#8217;t stop. So those kind of user experiences that, for example, in this podcast you could be listening to this podcast in WP Tavern, and you could navigate to the articles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, maybe you can be reading an article while you are listening to the podcast in the same way. And the podcast will keep playing. Those kind of user experiences are enabled by client side navigation. And you can also find in the movies the instant search that you start typing and the list of results is automatically updated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Infinite scroll could also work. Client size submissions like the comments form right now, in typical WordPress sites, when you submit a new comment, it triggers a page load. So this could be done directly in the client. So those are the kind of user experiences that we are talking about. And yeah, I think it&#8217;s important that this is totally compatible with the current block templating system. So whatever you change in the editor is going to keep working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:54] Nathan Wrigley: That&#8217;s great, yeah. Luis, anything to add?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:57] Luis Herranz: I would add that I really like that demo. Because it&#8217;s a demo that we didn&#8217;t come up with. It was a demo that existed before. There is a version of that demo created with all the major Javascript frameworks out there. So there is one for React using Next, Vue using Nuxt, Svelte, Quick, Astro and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you can compare now the WordPress version with the other Javascript frameworks, out there. I&#8217;m super happy to say that it really, in terms of user experience now with Interactivity API, you can provide the same user experience than the others. And this demo was created to show these type of complex or great user experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With WordPress, now with the Interactivity API, you&#8217;re able to create that type of user experience, but leveraging the server side and the block editor. So the other Javascript frameworks version is 100% code, where this movies demo version of WordPress is done with Gutenberg and everything is a block, and you can go and change wherever you want. Which we think it&#8217;s really powerful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s yet another thing there, in comparing with the other frameworks, and it&#8217;s that if you look at the performance is a top performer there. It&#8217;s only 13 kilobytes of Javascript. Only a new experimental mode of Solid is able to be as performant as that one. So yeah, I&#8217;m really happy about enabling those user experiences, but with full compatibility with the Block editor and block themes, and with such performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:44] Nathan Wrigley: It&#8217;s true to say, I guess, that if you go to that demo, you will not be seeing anything that you haven&#8217;t seen somewhere else online. You&#8217;ve seen the ability to like things, and you&#8217;ve seen infinite scroll before, and you&#8217;ve seen elsewhere online the ability to paginate without a full page refresh, and you&#8217;ve seen comments being added, again without having to submit a new page and so on and so forth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this is creating a standard inside of WordPress. Why did you feel it was important to do this? Why not just leave developers to do their own thing? Again, we&#8217;ve seen WordPress websites implementing this. You know, I&#8217;ve been to countless WordPress websites where I&#8217;ve seen these features.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clearly somebody&#8217;s dealt with it before and implemented it in their own way. I guess you&#8217;re just trying to make it so that everybody can build on top of the work that you are doing, rather than everybody going off in their own way and implementing a completely different solution based upon, well, however they wish to do it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:43] Luis Herranz: Yes. It&#8217;s about absorbing complexity. So, definitely anything you can imagine, it&#8217;s possible with WordPress. The thing is how easy is to do it. And with this kind of standard, our hope is that those user experiences are not only easy, but also working practically out of the box.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:05] Nathan Wrigley: I&#8217;m guessing that this standard is going to be something that you are aiming at developers. Presumably the developers will then make it fairly straightforward for end users to interact with blocks and what have you, to make this available to them. But how would the standard actually work? What is going on in the background? How are developers going to implement this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:25] Mario Santos: If I can add one note to the why this standard, is I think it&#8217;s also important to note apart from what Luis says, is that it absorbs a lot of complexity. In an ecosystem like WordPress where there are a lot of plugins interacting with other plugins and those kind of experiences that we have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important that following a standard enables things like block communication. For example, we can see what we were talking about in the demo that you are liking a movie and it&#8217;s updating another block, in another place. So if different blocks, created by different block developers, in different plugins are not using the same approach, it&#8217;s really difficult to be able to communicate those blocks. And having a standard solves that. And yeah, that composability and compatibility to nest the structures of different interactive blocks is possible thanks to a standard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:21] Nathan Wrigley: Right. Okay, so you&#8217;re really opening it up so that any block developer can implement this so that, I don&#8217;t know, a different block developer can hook into the exact same standards so that two completely separate blocks, created by completely separate individuals can have interaction via the Interactivity API, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:42] Mario Santos: Yeah, that&#8217;s it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:43] Luis Herranz: And they also use this, the same code, the same framework. Because if each block developer starts choosing their own framework, maybe some developers like React, some developers like Vue, some developers like Svelte or whatever comes next. Then WordPress sites could end up loading a lot of unnecessary Javascript.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, it&#8217;s important. Now that sites are, are a mix of blocks from different developers, these blocks are like small units. Yeah, it&#8217;s important to agree on a single kind of solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:17] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, good point. Okay, so how is it actually going to work then? You mentioned in the article, and I think one of you mentioned it just a moment ago, that you&#8217;re trying to make it so that people are familiar with PHP, don&#8217;t necessarily have to get into the whole space of learning React or what have you. I&#8217;m not entirely clear on what the position is there, but is the intention to make this as simple as possible for people who are steeped in WordPress&#8217;s PHP history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:44] Mario Santos: Yes. We wanted to make it as easy as possible to everyone. So yeah, that&#8217;s included. And yes, we said this is compatible with PHP, and it has been designed to be block first and PHP friendly. So yeah, it&#8217;s should be easy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And going back to the question, how this standard work. Basically a system based on directives. I&#8217;m not sure, for those who are not familiar with directives, they are a way to extend HTML. They are custom HTML attributes that tell the Interactivity API to attach a specified behavior to a DOM element, or even transform it. So for those familiar with Alpine. it&#8217;s really similar, but it has been designed to work with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:32] Nathan Wrigley: I know it&#8217;s potentially a bit on the technical side, but you talked about the CSS nature of things there. I&#8217;m wondering if you can give an example of how that might be implemented. What would you actually be doing, declaring those directives?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:47] Mario Santos: Okay, in order to create an interactive block using Interactivity API, you have to add directives to your markup. So you have some HTML, so you add custom attributes that are directives, and they call an action that is defined in Javascript in the view.js file of your block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:06] Nathan Wrigley: What is the benefit of doing it in that way? You mentioned that you want it to be available to everybody. Is this the kind of thing that, obviously experienced developers can probably pick this up in a heartbeat, but are you trying to get people, how do we describe this, who are less experienced say. Is this going to be something that you could pretty quickly learn even if your developer chops are not all that impressive?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:29] Luis Herranz: Yes. The initial goal for this proposal is more enabling user experiences for WordPress that were not possible before, or were very difficult to do before. We also have a focus on developer experience, but that&#8217;s something that we think we can also keep improving over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This doesn&#8217;t have to be like the final API of creating blocks. We can work, keep working on simplifying things over time. For example, right now none of these touches like the editor part. So if you are creating a block, the edit is just, is still done in the same way that it is done today using a React component. But maybe in the future we can explore how we can kind of extend these directives also to the editor and if it makes sense to unify and simplify the templating for both use cases. But is not the main goal of this proposal at this moment right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:32] Nathan Wrigley: When you were making decisions about this, and you decided to go with directives instead of things like using React or something. Was there quite a lot of toing and froing? Was there a lot of soul searching, what the best way to do it was? Or was it just fairly straightforward from the very beginning that using directives was the way you were going to do it? How long did the conversation take before you settled on this? is it fair to say that everybody&#8217;s on board with this? This seems to be the way to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:58] Mario Santos: We believe so. I mean, we have researched a lot of alternatives. Actually, as we mentioned, we come from Frontity, that it was a React framework. React was like the first alternative we had in mind, but we defined as a list of requirements and we started researching different possibilities, and at the end we come up with the solution to be the only one that it was the only one fully compatible with WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just to explain this a bit better. As directives are custom attributes that we have in the HTML, we are using the HTML as the templating system. And this comes with many benefits, for example, were not possible with React. As HTML is the templating system, the service rendering is supported by default, for example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is something really important in WordPress, or WordPress, APIs like WordPress hooks, that we are used to WordPress hooks in plugins, to extend some functionality, or translations. Those things, with directives using the HTML as the templating system work out of the box. And we can keep using those APIs to even extend the directives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think this was one of the main blockers to not use React. This system, the service rendering is supported, and the WordPress API are supportive as well. That using other approaches can get tricky or even impossible, I would say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:32] Luis Herranz: Yes. I think we spent like a year or so researching this. And at first we tried with Javascript, JSX, or even JS templates like Vue or Svelte, and so on. But yeah, I think that that direction, things start getting like super complex. And once we switched to using HTML as the templating language, it was like boom. Like everything works out of the box. Everything is like super simple. Everything is compatible. So yeah, it was like seeing the light a little bit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:04] Nathan Wrigley: if I&#8217;m a current block developer, there&#8217;s obviously now going to be this conflict of, do I carry on with what I&#8217;ve been doing so far? I&#8217;ve got some kind of interactive component in my blocks. Do I carry on with what I&#8217;ve been doing up until this point? Or do I flip over and start using the Interactivity API?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ve obviously just mentioned some reasons why that could be the case. But I&#8217;m wondering if there is anything else buried in there. In other words, what&#8217;s the use case to switch? There&#8217;ll be a bit of retooling, you might have to rewrite a whole bunch of stuff that you&#8217;ve already rewritten.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you think the benefit&#8217;s going to be in there purely for people who are creating new things? Or do you think there&#8217;s going to be a benefit for people who already have existing things out there in the real world, to go and rewrite what they&#8217;re doing using the Interactivity API?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:54] Luis Herranz: Of course, as everything in WordPress, this is optional. Even though we want it to become a standard. It&#8217;s optional. But there&#8217;s going to be some kind of sitewide experiences that can only be enabled if all the blocks use this language, or this standard. So yeah, our hope is that there&#8217;s not going to be any reason for new blocks to not use this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because it absorbs a lot of complexity and it works out the box with all these things. But there&#8217;s also going to be some benefit on migrating existing blocks to this system if you want to make your blocks compatible with these new user experiences. And also, get rid of all the complexity that you have to deal with in terms of bundling and performance and things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:42] Mario Santos: And actually it can also improve the user experiences, beause due to this complexity, we have seen many cases of blocks using React in the front end, but having issues with the server side rendering or not having server side rendering at all. So it could be a good approach to migrate to the Interactivity API, because it&#8217;s going to be easier to improve their blocks to support server side rendering, hooks, or other user experiences. There may be cases that they could benefit from that as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:13] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, I guess the intention would be for a slow but steady migration over to using the Interactivity API, to the point where it just doesn&#8217;t make sense to use anything else. One of you, I can&#8217;t remember which one of you it was, mentioned performance implications there. I&#8217;m just wondering if you could dwell on that a little bit. Have you, in your testing so far, really noticed this? Has it speeded things up, made less use of resources and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:39] Mario Santos: Yes. We&#8217;ve been testing and we want to test everything better and we will keep testing it in real sites. But it&#8217;s something that we had in mind from the beginning, that it has to be as performant as possible. And that&#8217;s why the runtime code is so small. It&#8217;s around 10 kilobytes. And yes, Luis before compared with other Javascript frameworks is performing pretty well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we did mention this, but it&#8217;s using React under the system. So that&#8217;s why it is so small. And yeah, it is actually performant and we are looking for other ways of optimizing it. For example, we want to only send the directives that are needed by the blocks that are in the page. Or we want to send the scripts so they don&#8217;t block the page rendering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or for example, we are also exploring the possibility of the scripts, so they are only load when they are in the view port. So, yeah, overall I would say it&#8217;s performant. It&#8217;s been designed to be performant. The code is relatively small, and we are still looking for ways to optimize it even more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:51] Luis Herranz: Yeah, I think that&#8217;s important. It&#8217;s not only performant today, but you have the guarantee that it&#8217;s going to be performant in the future, in the terms of you don&#8217;t have to, as a block developer, you don&#8217;t have to deal with performance in that sense anymore. Because that&#8217;s absorbed now by, well will be, hopefully absorbed by WordPress at some point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then if there&#8217;s something new in the web platform that can be leveraged to increase the performance and so on, it will be done in the WordPress side. So your block will just benefit from that, from just adopting this standard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:29] Nathan Wrigley: In the article that you wrote, Mario, the first word is the word proposal. Which implies that this is a work in progress, shall we say. And I&#8217;m just wondering how far down the path of usability you would say you&#8217;ve got. In other words, can developers begin using this out of the box? Have you seen real world examples of people using this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And have you had some interest from developers who perhaps haven&#8217;t implemented it, but certainly want to get on board? Because I&#8217;m guessing the more yes&#8217;s we can answer to that question, the more likely it is that other people will say, okay, yeah, let&#8217;s take a, let&#8217;s take a look at this. So, can you use it, and have people been using it?.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:08] Mario Santos: I would say, yes, you can use it, but we remind that this is still experimental, although we included the proposal word there. This is still experimental, very likely to change. So the APIs that we are using right now, that are used for example in the movies demo site, we are confident that they work, but maybe the syntax change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we haven&#8217;t promoted it yet to be used too much. There are people experimenting with it and giving feedback. For example, there&#8217;s an ongoing experiment in WooCommerce to replicate some of their blocks using directives. But there&#8217;s nothing in production yet because, as I said, this is still experimental.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are some missing functionalities that may break your site, and it doesn&#8217;t have any documentation yet. So, I would say you can use it at your own risk because it&#8217;s experimental. We would love people to test it. To give feedback. We want to understand better if it&#8217;s easy to use the blockers that people may face.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just to to clarify. In order to be able to use it, we are working on repository in GitHub. It&#8217;s a plugin that you can install, and from there you can create your own interactive blocks. Or if you prefer, there&#8217;s also the repository for the movies, with some examples that you can take a look and modify or whatever you want to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:34] Nathan Wrigley: Are those repositories linked from Mario&#8217;s article on make.wordpress.org?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:40] Mario Santos: Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:41] Nathan Wrigley: Okay, so perfect. So if you want to find those, you can just go to the article, which is going to be in the show notes and you can find them all there. Now you&#8217;re both working at Automattic, and although it was only about 30 minutes ago that you gave me your bio, I wasn&#8217;t quite sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that you&#8217;re both sponsored full-time in WordPress. Is this project, the Interactivity API, is this a focus for both of you at the moment? In other words, are you being asked to implement this, full-time, part-time? Are you tasked with making this happen?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:12] Luis Herranz: Yes, we are. But we are not the only ones. It&#8217;s a large group of contributors. But yes. It was part of when we stopped developing Frontity the headless framework, and joined Automattic, it was precisely to focus on this. And we thought it made a lot of sense. Yeah, and thanks to Automattic for sponsoring us to be able to work on this for WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:40] Mario Santos: One note on this, as you said, there are more contributors working on this Interactivity API, and yeah, we are part of a bigger group that is working on the whole developer experience of Gutenberg. So this is just a project to improve the front end interactive parts of your blocks, but there are ongoing efforts to improve the whole developer experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:04] Luis Herranz: Yeah, and maybe it&#8217;s a good moment to say that if anyone is interested in this topic, just come to the repository and so on. And contact us and join us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:15] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, I was going to ask about exactly that. How open are you to contributions? Presumably any people that you can get interested in this, the more the merrier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:24] Luis Herranz: A hundred percent open. We need people. We need people testing these. We need people using it. We need people giving feedback. Sharing different ideas. The most exposure, the better. How do you say that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:37] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, exactly that. So I guess really if this podcast serves to do anything, it would be exactly that. It would be to encourage people to go over. Read the post on make.wordpress.org, and if you&#8217;re interested and you think that you can help, then certainly it looks like your help would be most welcome. Testing, getting involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of what&#8217;s coming, you mentioned that there are things which you desire to have. So I guess that&#8217;s a roadmap question. What is on the roadmap? What do you want to have in there that is not in there? Don&#8217;t worry about timeframes. It might be a year off, two years off, six months, doesn&#8217;t really matter. What are you hoping that it will do that it currently is unable to do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:16] Mario Santos: Basically finish the Interactivity API, because it&#8217;s not finished. But, for example, our initial idea is to create the list of core directives that covers, I don&#8217;t know, 90% of the use cases, most of the use cases. Although then developers can create their custom directives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for example, that list is not finished yet. We still have to ensure that the APIs work for most of the use cases. We have to finish. And our idea for this is to, at some point, include it as experimental in Gutenberg. Start testing it in real core blocks, for example. Doing some experiments there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ensure that those user experiences are easy to create with the Interactivity API. Start receiving more feedback. So yeah, the idea is that. Keep experimenting. Keep developing the API. Receive feedback of users using it. And I think that&#8217;s it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:16] Luis Herranz: It&#8217;s going to be important the moment when we add, we added as experimental API in Gutenberg. Because that&#8217;s going to increase the exposure by, I don&#8217;t know, ten fold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>tenfold.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:25] Nathan Wrigley: One of you mentioned before we click record that you are going to be giving a presentation at WordCamp Europe around the Interactivity API. By good coincidence, this podcast episode is going out just prior to that. So it may be that people listening to this are very soon going to be getting in the car train or a plane to head to Athens. Which one of you is giving that talk and what is it that you&#8217;re going to be covering exactly?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:51] Luis Herranz: That would be me, Luis. I hope Mario helps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:55] Mario Santos: Yeah, I will help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:57] Luis Herranz: It&#8217;s going to be a workshop. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s a two hour workshop or two hour and a half workshop. It&#8217;s going to be hands-on. A step by step introduction to the Interactivity API and creating some interactive blocks and user experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:12] Nathan Wrigley: So very much a hands-on experience. You are going to be teaching people and hopefully getting them to learn in real time. Do you know if any of that gets recorded and put on WordPress TV?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:22] Luis Herranz: I don&#8217;t know if workshops are recorded or not. Presentations are, yes. I don&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:27] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, okay. So you can very much be seen at WordCamp Europe, in Athens. Hopefully both Luis and Mario are going to be there. Head over to the workshop and say hi, and get involved. If people want to reach out to either of you, be that on social media or email or whatever works best. Maybe we can go to Luis first. Can you give us some details of where people could get in touch with you, specifically around this topic?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:53] Luis Herranz: Sure. I actually started like, I left Twitter for a while and I&#8217;m back from last week or so. I&#8217;m going to try to answer any question that people may have about the Interactivity API and to share the progress there at my personal account, which is @luisherranz, like my name and surname in Twitter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:11] Nathan Wrigley: Thank you very much, and Mario, where can we reach you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:14] Mario Santos: I would say Twitter as well. I&#8217;m not actively tweeting, but if someone writes to me, I will answer for sure. Handle is @santosguillamot. It&#8217;s a bit difficult, so maybe it&#8217;s better to include the link?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:28] Nathan Wrigley: I will link to it in the show notes because yeah, that might be the best way of doing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:33] Luis Herranz: And probably I would say come by the Block Interactivity Experiments repository. So in GitHub, WordPress slash block interactivity experiments. And then there&#8217;s, open a issue, open a discussion. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:47] Mario Santos: And if people don&#8217;t use Twitter, I think they can reach both of us also in WordPress Slack, if they prefer to do so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:55] Nathan Wrigley: I will link to both of those things as well. I will include both of your Twitter handles and both of your Slacks, plus all of the links to anything that we mentioned during the course of the podcast. So yeah, an interesting discussion about the Interactivity API. I know it&#8217;s not just the pair of you, but Luis and Mario, much appreciation for taking on this work, which hopefully in the near future will be improving, not only the performance, but the interactivity of our WordPress websites. Thanks very much for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:21] Mario Santos: Thank you a lot for inviting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:23] Luis Herranz: Thanks, Nathan.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/santosguillamot\">Mario Santos</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/luisherranz\">Luis Herranz</a>. They both work for Automattic, but are sponsored to work full-time in WordPress. The main focus of their work is the block developer experience, and they are part of the group of contributors that worked on the Interactivity API proposal.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Interactivity API is the main focus of the podcast today, and if you&#8217;re working with blocks and dynamically displaying data, this is sure to be of interest to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We start out the podcast with the usual introductions and get to know Mario and Luis, and then we learn what the Interactivity API is, and what it can do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The conversation is framed around a blog post written by Mario entitled The Interactivity API, a Better Developer Experience in Building Interactive Blocks. In this, Mario shows examples of what website interactivity is. In short, it’s the ability for content to be amended on-the-fly without a page refresh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, this is nothing new on the web, we’ve been seeing this for years in WordPress sites and elsewhere, but now you’re going to be able to create interactivity in a standard way across the different blocks on your site. The project hopes to absorb complexity and make the creation of interactive objects fairly trivial. Mario and Luis talk about examples of where the API might be used and how it can be implemented.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also discuss the fact that in the past developers have gone their own way to make their sites interactive. It all works, but it means that no two implementations are the same. This causes issues if the project is taken over by another developer, but it’s also a drain on resources. Mario and Luis make the point that having a standard way of creating interactivity will benefit everyone in the long run.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get into the weeds a little and talk about the approach the team took when building the API. They decided to use directives, and we find out why this was and what benefit it brings over other possible solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The project is still experimental, and they’re looking for people to test and report back on what they find to move the Interactivity API forwards.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Frontity</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/30/proposal-the-interactivity-api-a-better-developer-experience-in-building-interactive-blocks/\">Proposal: The Interactivity API – A better developer experience in building interactive blocks</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/block-interactivity-experiments\">Interactivity API GitHib repo</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/wordpress/wp-movies-demo\">Repo for the movies demo</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2023/session/building-interactive-blocks-a-step-by-step-workshop/\">Luis&#8217; workshop at WordCamp Europe 2023</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/luisherranz\">Luis&#8217; Twitter</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/santosguillamot\">Mario&#8217;s Twitter</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/block-interactivity-experiments\">Block Interactivity Experiments repo</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 24 May 2023 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:3;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"HeroPress: About how WordPress saved my life. – Sobre como WordPress me salvo la vida\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=5574\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:140:\"https://heropress.com/essays/about-how-wordpress-saved-my-life/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=about-how-wordpress-saved-my-life\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15217:\"<img width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/052323-2-min.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pull Quote: The opportunity that the Universe gave me is called WordPress. La oportunidad que me dio el Universo se llama WordPress.\" /><p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/feed/#espanol\">Este ensayo también está disponible en español.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hello, my name is Rita Robles Loaiza, I am a computer systems engineer and I live in Cartago, Costa Rica. Today I want to tell you a little bit about my story and how WordPress saved my life.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-about-the-beginnings\"><strong>About the beginnings</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I am the youngest of 4 siblings, and the one who for many reasons as we say here in Costa Rica &#8220;went out of the basket&#8221;. Since I was a child I had an affinity for technology, I will never forget the first time I used a computer and how my older sister taught me to use Windows 95 back in 1997 or the first time I was able to program a Lego controller in Robotics class at the age of 12. Even with that affinity at 17 years old I said I wanted to be a chef, and I refused the idea of being an engineer. When I left school and the bubble in which I was I could identify that I had a whole world ahead of me and that I had to follow one of the best&nbsp; pieces of advice my mom could have given me: &#8220;Try hard&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>About My First Job and Entering the University.</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2013 I had the opportunity to start with my first job, that experience opened my mind and was my school, pure and hard about survival and behavior. This job was as an assistant in a Laboratory of chemical and microbiological analysis, the biggest WOW of my life I lived here, in the middle of test tubes, beakers, Erlenmeyer’s I realized all the potential I had, and that creativity and enthusiasm would be my two great weapons, this without knowing that my main virtue is and will be resilience. In the middle of that job and against my wishes I started to study programming, I really did not feel fulfilled even though I liked technology, the Rita of now believes that in the midst of so many changes that rejection was my defense mechanism to everything that was happening around me.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Leaving the Laboratory and the change of university</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After 2 years I suffered an extremely unfair dismissal disguised as economic problems in the company, after many years I understood that they did me a favor and that this action gave me the wings I needed to join the world of technology, while that happened to me and in the middle of my search for the true taste for what I was studying, I changed University, what a decision, so far has been the best I have taken in terms of education, thanks to that change I found what I really liked and was a breeding ground to achieve complete engineering. Finally, after all this, I was incorporated in different organizations with various roles focused on technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Rita turned to dust and ashes.</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>After a while and finishing my career, I decided to start my own business and entrepreneurship journey with 2 friends. Together we founded a boutique technology and innovation company, in the midst of our business empiricism we managed to meet many people and develop many projects, it was here where I had my first approach with WordPress in a meetup organized by the community of San Jose. At a certain point, my 2 friends abandoned the project and I decided to continue alone (big mistake), the company kept growing, I kept building many more projects, I incorporated more people until everything blew up in my face, it was absolutely unsustainable, and alone, without a job, and without any hope I became dust and ashes believing that I could not get up.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Teaching as a weapon of defense</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2018, the career director of the University where I studied contacted me to offer me the opportunity to be a Database teacher. I refused, believing that I did not have enough skills to assume that role, that thought was a product of everything that was happening with entrepreneurship, my director insisted, and I accepted, and that was how on May 19, 2018 I taught my first university class. From that moment until now, 5 years later, I can say that it was one of the smartest decisions I could make, teaching opened the doors to the possibility of rebirth, rebuilding myself and learning from my students. It was the university that in times of difficulties made me grow and get up from everything that was happening, it was here where I understood that resilience is and will be my greatest virtue.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>WordPress before my eyes</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2019, in a meeting of a women&#8217;s collective, I met the person who pushed me the most in this world, my great friend Ericka, she invited me to go to meetups of the WordPress San Jose community, I knew I had to make an extra effort to just limit myself to go to Meetups, so thanks to her and everything she told me about WordPress I took the initiative to look for tutorials and start learning on my own. It was in this year where I developed my first project with WordPress and opened the doors to one of the career paths that have made me feel happy and fulfilled.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">WordPress saved my life</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Excited by that project, I continued studying and getting involved in the community, participating in meetups, and organizing WordCamps, to the point that this year 2023 I had the opportunity to be Lead Organizer of WordCamp San Jose 2023. In 2019 in the midst of so much uncertainty came to me a job ad in GreenGeeks web hosting in the role of WordPress Specialist, without any expectation I sent my resume until I got the pleasant surprise that I was hired in February 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>WordPress and the COVID-19 pandemic</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It was thanks to this opportunity that I fully potentiated my taste and career towards WordPress, managing to get many projects for Foundations and NGOs in which through WordPress we can reach many interested people. It was also in this instance in which I managed to participate for the first time as a speaker at a WordCamp, this nourished my love for WordPress and the desire to continue sharing with all the people who have the same passion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress changed my life, put it in order and gave me guidelines to grow personally and professionally, the opportunity that the Universe gave me is called WordPress and all my life I will be grateful for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"kb-row-layout-wrap kb-row-layout-id_ade563-ae alignnone kt-row-has-bg wp-block-kadence-rowlayout\"><div class=\"kt-row-column-wrap kt-has-1-columns kt-row-layout-equal kt-tab-layout-inherit kt-mobile-layout-row kt-row-valign-top\">\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-column kadence-column_d879cf-9a\"><div class=\"kt-inside-inner-col\">\n<h2 id=\"work-environment\" class=\"kt-adv-heading_1e8c32-97 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\">Rita&#8217;s Work Environment</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>We asked Rita for a view into her development life and this is what she sent! </p>\n\n\n	<div class=\"hotspots-image-container\">\n		<img width=\"2560\" height=\"1144\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/IMG_5886-scaled-1.jpg\" alt=\"Rita\" class=\"hotspots-image skip-lazy\" />\n	</div>\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"kt-adv-heading_b61d45-c4 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading has-theme-palette-9-background-color has-background\">HeroPress would like to thank <a href=\"https://wpdrawattention.com/\">Draw Attention</a> for their donation of the plugin to make this interactive image!</p>\n</div></div>\n\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h1 id=\"espanol\" class=\"kt-adv-heading_96d019-44 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><strong>Sobre como WordPress me salvo la vida</strong></h1>\n\n\n\n\nEscucha el ensayo de Rita con su propia voz\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Hola, mi nombre es Rita Robles Loaiza, soy Ingeniera en sistemas de computación y vivo en Cartago, Costa Rica. Hoy quiero contarles un poco sobre mi historia y como WordPress me salvo la vida.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Sobre los inicios</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Soy la menor de 4 hermanos, y la que por muchas razones como decimos aquí en Costa Rica se “salió del canasto”. Desde que era niña tuve afinidad por la tecnología, jamás olvidare la primera vez que utilice una computadora y como mi hermana mayor me enseñó a utilizar Windows 95 allá por 1997 o la primera vez que pude programar un controlador de Lego en la clase de Robótica a los 12 años. Aun con esa afinidad a los 17 años decía que quería ser chef, y me negaba a la idea de ser Ingeniera. Cuando Sali del colegio y de la burbuja en la que me encontraba pude identificar que tenía todo un mundo por delante frente a mis ojos y que debía seguir uno de los mejores consejos que mi mamá me ha podido dar: “Esfuérzate”.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Sobre Mi primer trabajo y el ingreso a la Universidad</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>En el 2013 tuve la oportunidad de iniciar con mi primer empleo, definitivamente esa experiencia abrió mi mente y fue mi escuela, pura y dura sobre la sobrevivencia y el comportamiento. Este empleo fue como asistente en un Laboratorio de análisis químicos y microbiológicos, el mayor WOW de mi vida lo viví aquí, en medio de tubos de ensayo, beakers, erlenmeyers me di cuenta de todo el potencial que tenía y que la creatividad y el entusiasmo serian mis dos grandes armas, esto sin saber que mi principal virtud es y será la resiliencia. En medio de ese empleo y contra mis deseos empecé a estudiar programación, en serio no me sentía plena a pesar de que me gustaba la tecnología, la Rita de ahora cree que en medio de tantos cambios ese rechazo era mi mecanismo de defensa ante todo lo que sucedía a mi alrededor.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>La Salida del Laboratorio y el cambio de Universidad</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Después de 2 años sufrí un despido sumamente injusto disfrazado de problemas económicos en la empresa, después de muchos años entendí que me hicieron un favor y que esa acción me dio las alas que necesitaba para incorporarme laboralmente en el mundo de la tecnología, mientras me sucedía eso y en medio de mi búsqueda por el verdadero gusto hacia lo que estaba estudiando, me cambie de Universidad, vaya decisión, al momento ha sido la mejor que he tomado en temas de educación, gracias a ese cambio encontré lo que realmente me gustaba y fue caldo de cultivo para lograr completar la ingeniería. Finalmente, después de todo esto, me fui incorporando en distintas organizaciones con diversos roles enfocados en tecnología.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Rita convertida en polvo y cenizas</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Después de un tiempo y terminando mi carrera decidí iniciar el viaje al negocio propio y el emprendimiento con 2 amigos. Juntos fundamos una empresa boutique de tecnología e innovación, en medio de nuestro empirismo en negocios logramos conocer a muchas personas y desarrollar muchos proyectos, fue aquí donde tuve mi primer acercamiento con WordPress en un meetup organizado por la comunidad de San José. En un momento determinado, mis 2 amigos abandonaron el proyecto y yo decidí continuar sola (grave error), la empresa siguió creciendo, seguí construyendo muchos más proyectos, incorpore más personas hasta que todo exploto en mi cara, era absolutamente insostenible, y sola, sin empleo, y sin esperanza alguna me convertí en polvo y cenizas creyendo que no podía levantarme.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>La docencia como arma de defensa</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>En el 2018, el director de carrera de la Universidad en la cual estudie me contacto para ofrecerme la oportunidad de ser profesora de Bases de Datos. Yo me negué, creyendo que no tenía las habilidades suficientes para asumir ese rol, ese pensamiento era producto de todo lo que estaba sucediendo con el emprendimiento, mi director insistió y yo acepté, y así fue como el 19 de mayo del 2018 impartí mi primera clase universitaria. Desde ese momento hasta ahora, 5 años después, puedo decir que fue una de las decisiones más inteligentes que pude tomar, la docencia me abrió las puertas a la posibilidad de renacer, reconstruirme y aprender de mis estudiantes. Fue la universidad la que en tiempos de dificultades me hizo crecer y levantarme de todo lo que estaba sucediendo, fue aquí donde entendí que la resiliencia es y será mi mayor virtud</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>WordPress ante mis ojos</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>En el 2019, en una reunión de un colectivo de mujeres, conocí a la persona que más me impulso en este mundo, mi gran amiga Ericka, ella me invito a ir a meetups de la comunidad de WordPress San José, yo sabía que debía hacer un esfuerzo adicional a solamente limitarme a ir a Meetups, así que gracias a ella y todo lo que me contaba sobre WordPress tome la iniciativa de buscar tutoriales y empezar a aprender por mi cuenta. Fue en este año donde desarrolle mi primer proyecto con WordPress y abrir las puertas a uno de los caminos laborales que más me han hecho sentir feliz y plena.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>WordPress salvo mi vida</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Emocionada por ese proyecto, seguí estudiando e involucrándome en la comunidad, participando en meetups y organizando WordCamps, a tal punto que este año 2023 he tenido la oportunidad de ser Lead Organizer del WordCamp San José 2023. En el 2019 en medio de tanta incertidumbre llego a mi un anuncio de empleo en GreenGeeks web hosting en el rol de WordPress Specialist, sin expectativa alguna envié mi currículo hasta llevarme la grata sorpresa que me contrataron en febrero del 2020.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>WordPress y la pandemia del COVID-19</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fue gracias a esta oportunidad que potencialice completamente mi gusto y carrera hacia WordPress, logrando conseguir muchos proyectos para Fundaciones y ONG en los cuales por medio de WordPress podemos llegar a muchas personas interesadas. También fue en esta instancia en la cual logre participar por primera vez como speaker en un WordCamp, esto alimento mi cariño hacia WordPress y el deseo de poder seguir compartiendo con todas las personas que tenemos esta misma pasión.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress cambio mi vida, la puso en orden y me dio pautas para crecer personal y profesionalmente, la oportunidad que me dio el Universo se llama WordPress y toda mi vida estaré agradecida por eso.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/about-how-wordpress-saved-my-life/\">About how WordPress saved my life. &#8211; Sobre como WordPress me salvo la vida</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://heropress.com\">HeroPress</a>.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 24 May 2023 12:30:01 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Rita Robles Loaiza\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:101:\"WPTavern: Automattic Releases wp-now: A Local Development Environment Powered by WordPress Playground\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=145373\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:111:\"https://wptavern.com/automattic-releases-wp-now-a-local-development-environment-powered-by-wordpress-playground\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2530:\"<p>Automattic has published a new project called <a href=\"https://twitter.com/AutomatticEng/status/1660997741793927168\">wp-now</a> that creates a local development environment in seconds.

Hey.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:04] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> All right. Session 14. I had to go on YouTube and look, but golly, that&#8217;s been. Three months, three and a half months. Been good stuff. Had fun on these, but we have some good things to talk about today. I think you were gonna show me some of that stuff and come up with a punch list of what you&#8217;ve been manically working on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m meager man. And I know the other part of the agenda is now baton is. Getting handed over to me to really drive marketing and the work of, that I can actually do with your class. Yep, exactly. Genius and insight and feedback. All right, you want to any thoughts or do you want to kick&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:53] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> it off and No, lemme share. Which 1:00 AM I sharing? [00:01:00] Share, update, plugin. Let&#8217;s make it smaller. Come on window.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You see that? Okay? Yep. And hold on just a second. Where is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Real life needs and leads of a dog. Must be in the office with me at all times. Okay, go lay down. All right we have a blog WordPress install. I&#8217;ve been testing with Yost, but for the fun of it, we&#8217;ll leave that. Deactivated general settings. Oh, it&#8217;s interesting that didn&#8217;t reset. But anyway, the title of this blog tagline, so this is the description of this blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m just like, some things I [00:02:00] want to sensible, sensible defaults basically And looking at these variables because they&#8217;ll show up later. If you go, so you have a WordPress install you&#8217;ve just downloaded O M G I M G we need Oh, you have that WorkFlowy document I think I shared with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Did. So these are, I&#8217;ll take notes here. Plug in marketing. So it&#8217;s like, what do we call the damn thing? I plugged in. It&#8217;s O M G I M G and all capital letters we decided on, which I love. And then what do we call it? I&#8217;m, so a couple of neat things with this. We, I think we, we touched on it a little bit or I was thinking it earlier today, is we don&#8217;t need, because we&#8217;re not going in the plug-in repo, we don&#8217;t need a readme, we don&#8217;t need there&#8217;s a bunch of SEO [00:03:00] stuff that we don&#8217;t need to worry about, that we were messing around with Crop Express.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think we still want, we still need a description for here. We still need do we just call it O M G I M G? Do we want another word? Image builder, maker, candlestick maker, something in there. So yeah, what do we call it? What should be like, What we see on the plugins page,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Description name oops. All right. So anyway we activate it. It takes you to a welcome screen. Right now it says, welcome to O M G I M G. Let&#8217;s get you started creating your first image, an open graph image for your site. The first image is the image people see when they share your [00:04:00] sites on socials.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we can review all this copy later, but Roger that we just need an icon I&#8217;ve been using, actually let&#8217;s do, if I go to post status, it&#8217;s gonna be the real lit litmus test, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is there a high res version? Hey, look at that. Holy leash. Nikes. No, that&#8217;s good. It&#8217;s an svg. Okay which we don&#8217;t support currently. We&#8217;re gonna want to I can. I got it. Because we can just go SVG to p and g. It&#8217;s one of my favorite. These are my favorite sites. There&#8217;s this whole series of sites that look just like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s compress P and g. Yeah, compress jpeg, compress All these are my favorite sites. With the elephant. And I contacted this person once and I was like, can I give you money because I use your websites,[00:05:00] every day. And he is no, I make more from ads than you could ever give me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. It&#8217;s a good problem to have anyway, so let&#8217;s show.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Did it really make it that small?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, no, it really does make it that small.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. So yes, you should send me a version if you have it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I should have asked you for this earlier,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>SVG whole doc. Why not? It really is that small though.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What size do you need? I&#8217;ve got just as big as possible with the transparent background.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve got three 20,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:41] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> about three 20. Let&#8217;s see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had these made for Different social platforms. So they&#8217;re already scaled down.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep. Do you want an eps?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:54] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> I think I&#8217;ve almost got it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:55] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> We&#8217;re illuminating some of the things that we&#8217;ve talked about,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:59] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> right? [00:06:00] Yeah. Around tight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep. Yep. This is compelling listening and watching for anybody out there. There we go. I got it. And I&#8217;m being a little pedantic because I want this to be a good demo for you. Oops. Export p and g thousand by a thousand giggles. Heat export. Having fun. Download save. All right, I got it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:39] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>LeBron Giggle in their heat map software is probably going, oh my God.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:44] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Tertiary dancing. All right, I&#8217;m gonna drag in the PS logo, see if this works. Hey, you get a little preview. So there&#8217;s a bug. Go bugs [00:07:00] dropping image shows preview, but placeholder doesn&#8217;t. Disappear.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doesn&#8217;t matter though. So you create, so this is going to automatically generate the first one based on I think it&#8217;s the, oh, let&#8217;s find out. And there&#8217;s a fatal error because get options hasn&#8217;t been set site. There&#8217;s a little live coding for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>obviously I haven&#8217;t walked through this in a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh. Called up there. I see.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What did happen?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, I know what I did. Yeah. So change this to until good options. [00:08:00] There we go. Let&#8217;s try that again. Refresh. Grab the PS logo, P and G</p>\n\n\n\n<p>and nothing happens. Okay, skip. Anyway it should have created one, but we&#8217;ll create one. So this is the other workflow, basically the idea being that welcome screen, you drop in a logo and then it just spits one out. Yep. So that you&#8217;re not, so that you&#8217;re, on board you, and obviously we&#8217;ll tweak that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I wanted to get that we had talked about. The experience of it. Essentially you drop an image and it&#8217;s just done and then you&#8217;d click then option to set it as an OG image. But here we&#8217;ll say created open OG image. Right now we&#8217;ve got logo only and then side by side are mostly working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Top bottom isn&#8217;t done and simple was the old version I need to clean up, but we&#8217;ll start with logo only. Let&#8217;s see if this works.[00:09:00] We&#8217;re close. Line app, line one 20. Oops. Of course I&#8217;ve been hacking away at this, so lots of errors. I get it. No issue here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But anyway okay, so real simple, I just want this to go away. If set.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There we go. So real simple options here. You&#8217;ve got a background and you&#8217;ve got an image. And so that&#8217;s all the options that you&#8217;ve got here on the left. So you can set a background color. So if we go to Do you know what color the post status orange is? It&#8217;s the,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>like the official&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:51] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:53] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> oops, I spelled you wrong. Post status.com. There we go. [00:10:00] Inspect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s that one. Okay, so hypothetically you&#8217;d come in, you&#8217;d say, oh, and I&#8217;ve added global options. So there&#8217;s under settings, you can set a site name if you want it different than the WordPress name, site description, site url. There&#8217;s also going to be Default colors. So it&#8217;s if you create a new one, instead of you having to set the background color every time it&#8217;d import these.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also think I showed you, I just added or showed a screenshot. I just added support for Google. Fonts a little clunky but is working, which is cool. Ah, okay. So this is what it was supposed to do, is it creates your first project With, here&#8217;s your channel, here&#8217;s your template. So logo only, open graph.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So anyway, back in the editor, so you changed the [00:11:00] background color to be the post status one, and of course it doesn&#8217;t paste FC 78 15.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>FC 78 15. So there&#8217;s the post status low color. I added an overlay just by default, so if you wanted to add like, A gradient, something to make it a little more dynamic. I&#8217;m gonna add a little toggle for this so you can turn it off all, all together. You can also rotate it so you can make the gradient come from a different direction if you want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess the hack right now is you would just go in here and make this the same as that orange. Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looks like it&#8217;s still adding a gradient, but anyway. But the idea is right now I&#8217;ve added, I&#8217;m basically flushing out. I&#8217;m trying to flush out like one of each option, like a color picker, a or slider, [00:12:00] a bunch of different things. And so we can keep adding these selectors basically. So you can, you&#8217;ll have options all day long.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You come over here and. So that&#8217;s how you could figure the background, right? And then for the image this should by default, say site logo, which is the thing we uploaded. But I&#8217;ve added support for the media library. So if you wanted to do let&#8217;s grab one of my testing document WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nope. Testing. So I&#8217;ve been using this gear, so you could also select an image from the media library or the default site logo. You set the size, you could rotate it. Rotate it if you want to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So dead simple. Save your changes. And it&#8217;s there every time, right? There&#8217;s an option to view it, [00:13:00] full screen. And then there&#8217;s the, you saved say download. I don&#8217;t know if you, I don&#8217;t think you can see that part, but it downloads right now. It&#8217;s a funny name, but we&#8217;ll give it a better name when you download it so you&#8217;ll know what it looks like in the download.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there&#8217;s also the option to save it as your open graph image. And so we don&#8217;t really have a way to demo that, but what it does is it will it&#8217;ll write headers to your, to, to the website so that anytime your website is shared this&#8217;ll be your OG image. Okay. And then also so I think, so it&#8217;s saving it as OG image.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Puts it into your media library and then. And then that&#8217;s what gets shared out. So another bug here or an extra feature we want is to save. In addition, to save as to download, we wanna be able option to save to media Library. [00:14:00] So it&#8217;ll just show up in the media library. And saving is the OG image.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when you go back to projects, there&#8217;s a little flag that says this is your OG image, cuz you can only have one obviously. And so it&#8217;s if you set a different one. So here&#8217;s that same menu you can download directly from here. Or save it as the OG image. And then, and this&#8217;ll replace whatever one is the OG image.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s create another. Go ahead. Yeah, let&#8217;s create&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:26] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> another one. But how did you get the name Project five? Number&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:29] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> five. So it&#8217;s, these are just like posts. So if you create A post has an id. So project number five. So yeah, one of the Go&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:39] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> ahead default, or we just naming that by default or do they have the&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:44] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> What would we name it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:47] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> No, I was it. Do we, do they have the option to name it&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:52] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> something different? Oh, they don&#8217;t yet. So let&#8217;s add that to the list. Custom project [00:15:00] name</p>\n\n\n\n<p>because, yeah, I thought about that too, like that once it gets up to 1,986,426, it&#8217;s like, what&#8217;s, which one are we talking about?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:12] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I&#8217;m just thinking too, for sorting, like we probably want to say it&#8217;s O N G I M G and then they name it like default homepage or something. And then when we get into the single post pages and stuff, maybe it&#8217;s post ID or post name and number or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just so they, when they see this page, it&#8217;s gonna get pretty filled.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:37] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yep. Yeah, the here it says SITEWIDE images. I don&#8217;t think this is working right now because I&#8217;ve made a bunch of changes to the site version. There is a menu option here for O M G I M G per post. Yeah, it&#8217;s totally broken right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;ll, when it&#8217;ll look similar, [00:16:00] but it, but up here it says, Name of post, today&#8217;s specials or whatever, and then it, and then has your images, so you do have context. But yeah under the project number name we&#8217;ll want to come up with some naming convention. The other thing that I, so let&#8217;s do that custom project name, but right off the bat, maybe a date or we could do the name of the template.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Default project name, using date or template or both because it would be like April 26th. OG image would at least give you some context.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:40] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Ni picky. But when you say CRI project, that button right there. Yep. C. Could that be create O n G? Im G.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:48] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not nitpicky. That&#8217;s the kind of stuff I please jump in. Okay. Especially cuz most, most of those changes are small. Yeah. Yeah. I&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:58] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> think coming back to the branding, like [00:17:00] that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing is M G I M G and that&#8217;s what they&#8217;re getting and I think&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:04] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> that&#8217;s good. Yep. Okay. Let&#8217;s do another open graph.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Actually let&#8217;s do an Instagram and again. So instead of logo only now we get into side by side, so it&#8217;s a bit more complicated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this is a logo on the left and text options on the right. So again, we do a background color. See there&#8217;s a little bug of. That border.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:35] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> You&#8217;re a very daring dev. I always like doing this stuff though, but a lot of devs have worked with her, like they don&#8217;t want to see, they don&#8217;t want you to see some of this. I&#8217;m like,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:45] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Hey. Oh, I want you to see it as broken as possible. Cuz then it&#8217;s like one, one, it&#8217;s part of the journey and what we&#8217;re trying to illustrate with all of our, everything we, we&#8217;ve been doing in public Mo honestly, most of our conversations have been [00:18:00] public.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s I also wanna show, this is as part of our journey. You have barely usable products, but it&#8217;s, then you clean it up. So same thing, overlay color, make it nice and ugly for you. So let&#8217;s just do white and green. With that angle. The image, again, you can choose, that&#8217;s supposed to be site</p>\n\n\n\n<p>site, logo side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just clicking through to see that it all works, so it changes to this other thing. Or you jump back and it&#8217;s the site logo, make it bigger title. So this is the stuff that I&#8217;ve been really working on right now. I&#8217;m, I don&#8217;t have Google fonts enabled. I. But you still get the idea. So we&#8217;ve got some default font families basically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you wanted handwritten I [00:19:00] don&#8217;t know if bold works. No, I was just doing that this morning. But you will have the option to ignore this input and you will have, but you will have the option to say bolder italics, cuz it&#8217;s I want you to be able to customize the text to your heart&#8217;s content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Text color. So you might hear, you might match the orange type of thing, text size,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>but you&#8217;d say, I want this tighter. There&#8217;s line height. If you wanna get, what&#8217;s that tweak to your heart&#8217;s content. Exactly. And again, these are not quite the, like you gave me some comps of the ultimate post status. Social image. And so based on that, I want to give us, give you all the options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you were a customer coming in, you&#8217;d say, okay, I&#8217;d upload my logo here. I might choose a a font that not looks like that. [00:20:00] Like that. I&#8217;d want it bold, I&#8217;d want it all caps. So we want all those options. And then, Be able to make it look good in the context of this template. There&#8217;s the title, then you go to the subtitle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so you&#8217;d have site url, site description. Remember I said, this is where we put in the description of the blog. But it&#8217;s like most likely you&#8217;d want the title of the blog and the url, so you&#8217;d do that, but it&#8217;s, and there&#8217;s a setting for let me save this. So there&#8217;s a setting again. So by default, if you&#8217;re like, our webs, our website is http and www, but we really just want it to be post status.com or if you had a short u r l, po.st or something like that, you could put that in here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s do post status.com. [00:21:00] Save. Go back to here. Oh. So you know, this is what your project screen looks like. So you&#8217;ll see all of your projects. And yeah, we&#8217;re gonna want ability to sort projects by name most recently updated, et cetera. So we&#8217;ll add that to that screen. Jumping back in here, Seesa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, the, by default it brings in post status.com, but there&#8217;s also an option of custom text. So if you wanted to put in dot, something or post status.com, link to, something specific, a blog, something like that, right? Text color X size, but you get the idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:00] So yeah, that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re at.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No problem, dude.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:05] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So from the premise of the Sitewide OG image probably when I was doing that for, it was so good. Can I show you some stuff&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:14] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> real quick? Yeah, absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:16] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Okay. So I was playing, this is off topic, but I was playing with some of this, like more into the blog post stuff. So you can see some of these things. I was just like trying to be the client. This is not it. Okay. Where did that play with it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s in our.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this side by side image, I think side by side thing is gonna be really great for the in, in just what we need for. Initial stuff. Yep. So I was running around with like logo on top here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:52] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah, your number 15 is what I was emulating and then. Once, once I&#8217;ve got all the kinks worked [00:23:00] out, it&#8217;s easy enough to duplicate it to, I called it top and bottom or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So logo above, and so that becomes your like 14 or 13 where it&#8217;s the same elements on the page. Just, up and down instead of left and right. Yeah, I really, as I was&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:18] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> doing this just for post, I was like, this is what, this is really what you need. You just need. Logo, brain thing, tagline. And so that was really good for me to go through that experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yeah, I guess I&#8217;ve got four cards here. Put it on the right, put it on the left, but it above, but it below.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:40] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yep. And I, and so actually I&#8217;m now thinking, so maybe I. Like I do the, just an image, cuz that was one of the ones we saw on that gallery. And then, and I think it&#8217;s a really good place to start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically it&#8217;s the simplest. And then we will, [00:24:00] and then I will adjust the side by side to be, we&#8217;ll call it the, like the default business card. And I will put in little toggles that are like, Because again, it&#8217;s, I&#8217;m trying to flush out potential options, right? And so if there was an option that was like logo left top, right bottom, cuz it&#8217;s all essentially the same.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of those cards from our perspective are the same, just reordering of things. But logo, title, U R L. And I just lock that shit down and then we&#8217;re ready to publish, essentially, like I, as you saw, like I wanna, I want to clean up the welcome screen a little bit more cuz I do think that onboarding&#8217;s gonna make a big difference rather than it just being a blank screen when you sign in and it&#8217;s done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was pretty simple to implement. Yeah, I really think, and then,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:58] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Go ahead. Just go to the experience [00:25:00] is like those five are all we need. Yep. Specifically for the homepage you saw here, just this is for next level step stuff. Yep. But I was like, when you told me I could have a screenshot, I was like, oh yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:16] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Oh yeah. When once I add that, like that&#8217;s gonna be a lift. Because it&#8217;s, a screenshot within a screenshot kind of thing. But so I&#8217;ll circle back to that. But is, so is this your official, the official font of post status? Yes. And what font is it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Go round A round. I believe&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:40] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> it&#8217;s a Google font.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, it is.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:43] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Okay. And do you make it bold or is it just, is that how it comes? I&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:49] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I did for this stuff. I don&#8217;t know the original, how this is all done, but I was trying to match it and Sure. That won&#8217;t work for me. It is bold.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:58] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Okay. [00:26:00] So by having Google fonts right now, so there are 1500, I think 1,508 Google fonts, and we, just so you know, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that we are not, because a plug-in, can&#8217;t call, dial out without permission and you can&#8217;t get Google font information without an API key. We can&#8217;t expect our users to go through all those steps, so you have to enable Google fonts within the plugin. But I set it up so that now I&#8217;m just bragging, but I&#8217;m proud of myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got us a Google a p i key Once a day we hit the Google Fonts API and get all the information. We store it on omg.co. I created a little API there, and so the plugin, anybody&#8217;s [00:27:00] plugin will hit omg img.co. That meaning our website to get all the font data, and then it&#8217;ll be, and then it&#8217;ll be cashed on in their own website too, but, so it was, The sort of clever way if I do say so myself, not, it&#8217;s not super tricky, but so we, so pretty quick, I was able to pretty quickly add Google font support the without the user having to do much, which is cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, right now all it does is create a dropdown that has 1,508 names of fonts For you, for now that you can, you would just go, sorry, select Vare around from that dropdown. But we&#8217;re gonna have to add some way to preview all of those fonts, anyway, I wanna make sure that Varela round bold works for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don&#8217;t do italics, you don&#8217;t rotate anything, but I had fun implementing that [00:28:00] stuff. And for you, it&#8217;s just a white background. Yeah. Oh, so I want to add, toggle the background overlay. So you can just disable it and just say, set a white background. And then that default. Color picker. I couldn&#8217;t, I had to type in the color.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I couldn&#8217;t paste it in, which was a pain in the ass doesn&#8217;t support pasty. So I think we want a better color picker so that somebody could go copy an eight. Most people are gonna have a hex code color and so they&#8217;re gonna want to paste it in. Yep. Okay. So gimme 20 minutes. Just sit there quietly for 20 minutes and I will have this ready for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just kidding. Okay. I can&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:50] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> be quiet. So then I went a little further into thinking through how we want those, and I came back to this. [00:29:00] Yep. Featured image stuff and going and let you know, just try to present some what we probably want on things. I did show, I did see. Yep. There, I did it. Let&#8217;s see if I can, your&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:15] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> hair&#8217;s getting long.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Huh? Your hair is getting long. In that picture,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:21] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I showed you that thing. I just saw some from Twitter, but it was just a quote with a person&#8217;s picture on it. I was like, that&#8217;s cool. Cuz a lot of the podcast stuff we&#8217;re doing</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like something like this where you have the person you&#8217;re interviewing with their little quote. I&#8217;ll keep working on those. Thinking about those, cuz those outputs were really good. Like we do so much audio, video stuff. And really been working with content journey to break those down more and more where you get clips and stuff like that, that then go out on social that are more valuable content on there [00:30:00] than just listen to 45&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:01] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> minutes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But what you just said more valuable, we were talking earlier about like taglines and concepts and stuff. More valuable images.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. Because we were talking like. Making you look more professional, which I bucked at cuz it&#8217;s it implies you don&#8217;t look professional now or as opposed to like we are. And also going back a handful of conversations that we had where it&#8217;s like crop Express was solving a problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We were a wrench, you had a bolt. We could help tighten the bolt faster kind of thing. Whereas this, technically you can live without this, but we are making ev making your website better.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:52] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> It&#8217;s the polish. Yeah. It&#8217;s like you said, the last mile of Polish, yep. Done work doing [00:31:00] the 45 minute thing, doing the thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then this is that last mile that you said, I&#8217;d like that toughest mile of just polish. Yep. We&#8217;re making that really to display that. When I was thinking through the blog post stuff, I was like, that&#8217;s what I&#8217;d want is, when we shove out a podcast episode that&#8217;s not guy, oh, they did another thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if we have that quote from somebody in there that really resonates, then it&#8217;s I should go and look more. And what we&#8217;re trying to do on the content side is break those up better and better with transcripts, show notes and stuff like that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:36] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah, initially, so I&#8217;ve added that. Basically it&#8217;s a content field, so it&#8217;s like you pull in the title of the website, you&#8217;d pull in whatever, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that, that the last option was custom text. And the label on the left would say quote, and then you&#8217;d say custom text. And you&#8217;d put in a quote and you&#8217;d have [00:32:00] this saved as a default. So you&#8217;ve got post sta, a white background and the post status logo and U R L in the bottom right print that, that&#8217;s quote number one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re now looking at that screen that has all of your projects and you&#8217;d say duplicate post or duplicate project. You change the name to quote number two. You&#8217;d go in paste in the second quote, and now you&#8217;ve got two of those images, same picture of the woman, but two different quotes. So you&#8217;d download one to post on socials on Tuesday and you&#8217;d download the second one to post on socials on Thursday.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gosh.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:39] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So it&#8217;s been a bit a second on this blog post thing. So all those, I gather, you&#8217;re probably setting it up where it&#8217;s set in the front. When you do a post, there could be these options that you could fill in to create all those images. And right there I can do that. So I&#8217;m looking at [00:33:00] the post, oh, that quote there is the template plug and play.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like if you saw on this one screen, I was</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why you get to Drift.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re gonna get in. The valuable part is something that looks nice enough and allows me to share those things out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:25] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah, and I think, like we&#8217;ve talked about, I. A number of those different templates of, or scenarios, an image that you generate that&#8217;s got a picture of a per, for your interview, you&#8217;ve got their picture on the left, and then you&#8217;ve got a quote and you can make five of those five different quotes, but it&#8217;s essentially the same image.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And initially, Today, tomorrow, this week, like I&#8217;ll set up that template next week. You&#8217;re using it and you&#8217;re plugging it. You know you&#8217;re gonna have to cr [00:34:00] recreate that template every time. But a week from now, I&#8217;m gonna give you the option to duplicate a template and or save a template. For reuse, essentially.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So then step two is gonna be okay. It&#8217;s I set it up once for each post and then and then I&#8217;ve gotta manually plug in those quotes and then step three, like basically to verify that, that we are using it this way and that these are loops that we want to close or processes that we wanna make faster.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like I&#8217;m picturing a. A screen where essentially you can quick generate, if you&#8217;ve got a bunch of these templates that like, opens up in the sidebar, your, you go and you look at your blog post and you highlight something, and then you select from a dropdown like, plug this, whatever text I&#8217;ve highlighted into this template.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s highlight a quote. Generate a quote, image [00:35:00] highlight, quote number two, generate quote, image, highlight bullet points you instead of the quote template, use a, use the bullet point template and you just go bang. Okay, all done. Go back to I M G O M G I M G project screen and there&#8217;s all of those different templates populated, already with your logo, but quote one, quote two, quote three, bullet 0.1, bullet 0.2, bullet 0.3.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think it&#8217;d be&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:27] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> okay, let me just make sure we&#8217;re on the same page. And I&#8217;m sorry if I missed this, but, so I was thinking post templates I&#8217;d want for most post ads content. I put down quote and summary slide. It&#8217;s probably the two big ones, just summary slide about what this content is about and then actionable cool quotes on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I started plugging up MGM G. I could create a template for the post things that would show, then [00:36:00] set there for its to global, and then I&#8217;m in post writing, post and go ready for the OG images, click. Oh, I want to do, I gotta have a summary slide that&#8217;s already in my template over you on the post. And then same thing with quote, I&#8217;d have that option too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those templates would show up</p>\n\n\n\n<p>because right there, from a workflow standpoint, I&#8217;m thought about, I&#8217;ve done the work of thinking about some of the key things that would drive value on the post content summary slide, which is our featured image thought. And then the quote Thing and I&#8217;ll, maybe the bullet point would be the third for me is like we, we talked about these three things, which could be a variation of the summary slide.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure. And if I did that, what that would do for me on my social channel is just talking this out as opposed to as, okay, I&#8217;ve already illuminated in a graphically appealing way what this long form post is about. Then I have those images for [00:37:00] those channels. LinkedIn, Twitter primarily for us at the appropriate sizes and stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we&#8217;re cooking. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:10] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yep. Yeah, I like we&#8217;ve talked about the baseline is an OG image, ideally auto generated The moment you hit publish, you&#8217;ve based on a template being populated with the title of the post and then down the road with a screenshot of the post, and or the featured image.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But once you&#8217;ve done kind of what is considered the word press basics, you&#8217;ve added categories, you&#8217;ve added a featured image, you&#8217;ve written your blog post, you&#8217;ve hit publish. Already when you share it, it looks damn good. There&#8217;s maybe a little bit of setup, but if you haven&#8217;t set up an OG image template or an OG image template for a, for that post, [00:38:00] then at least when somebody shares it, they get the sitewide business card, like you&#8217;re describing it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But with the next step. Every post that gets created automatically has a business card, but has the title of that post built in. And then step three, you could essentially recreate reuse that same one, let&#8217;s say make it a square for Instagram. And so again, you&#8217;re going, up and out with all these things and it&#8217;s just a matter of how you use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So like at post status, your. You&#8217;re going, okay. Baseline is an OG image, but we also then want and that&#8217;s gonna cover your LinkedIn and Facebook. But you&#8217;re like, but we need a square for Instagram. Copy. Change it to, I didn&#8217;t show you that part. So it&#8217;s like that we select that channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You saw that the second image I created was for Instagram. You can actually change that live. So you could take a rectangle image, you could replicate it, so [00:39:00] now you&#8217;ve got another one. But you could say, now make this square and it&#8217;ll just change. And things might move around on the screen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you might want to go tweak, tweak some of those sliders. But if you&#8217;ve already done the work once, copy change screen size.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:14] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Okay, let me talk this through. From a marketing customer Perspective. So what I&#8217;ve gathered, cuz I want us to capture this for the market, my marketing work, but I&#8217;m, I need to say that out loud to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what this has done for me as the content marketer at Post status is it&#8217;s in my workflow. It&#8217;s creating I&#8217;ve said my templates, I&#8217;ve thought these things, o n g has helped me. Do those, think through those these are the basic things you can do to add value to your post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s in my workflow. It&#8217;s great cuz I&#8217;m going to my post. I&#8217;m adding new podcast, new blog posts, whatever. I&#8217;ve already done this initial workflow work to set my templates that are there for me when I need it. It looks nice, [00:40:00] like it doesn&#8217;t look like shit. It looks nice. And then the third is it, this is just direct speed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It illuminates the value of the post better. I&#8217;m pulling out the things to showcase what the post actually is, so I&#8217;m enticing people to do that. The fourth I didn&#8217;t add down here though, is making it super easy to go off and share. So for marketing wise, right there, we talk to content marketers first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re already doing this work. Yep. It&#8217;s in your workflow. It&#8217;s gonna look nice. It&#8217;s gonna share, showcase the value of the landing page better, and then it&#8217;s easy to share.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:43] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> So that last mile talking about the last mile is the hardest mile. Is also an aspect that I think. Mar like marketers and marketing agencies, it&#8217;s going to make sense to [00:41:00] them that we don&#8217;t close the loop on actually publishing to your average person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I th I anticipate this being a discussion. This we&#8217;re gonna have to have over and over again. Corey, with his little music blog. In a perfect world, We would generate images for each channel and then we&#8217;d click a button that would say, push these to these channels. Yep. But it&#8217;s, but that is so a big, messy step.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. And there are tools that already do it. And again, from a marketer or an agency is already going to be using a radar, a buffer, a hoot suite to queue up and publish this content.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:59] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah.[00:42:00] So I was thinking though, like your Instagram, I go, huh, when am I gonna use that? But the Vida bars company, Lindsay has an investment in helps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She&#8217;s got shampoo and conditioner bars. She primarily uses Instagram, right? So she&#8217;s creating a post, wants something that then she can download and just upload back to, that publishing option. They&#8217;re great services that do all that. To me, it&#8217;s yeah, we&#8217;ve handed it on the thing, now go use your tools, your workflows.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. You&#8217;re already in that workflow. But man I think that&#8217;s awesome. Okay. I&#8217;ve only, sorry, I&#8217;ve only got four more minutes, but here&#8217;s my question to you. What do you think needs to happen for it to be ready for&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:39] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> production on Postex? Like I said, I need to clean up some of these bugs and I am now going to, so I&#8217;ve already created options that, that post status based on the template you gave me, I think we&#8217;re [00:43:00] pretty much covered.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like we&#8217;ve got Google font support. You can upload a logo, you can pull in a title, and I am going to clean it all up so that it works and you stop seeing errors when you first install it. But I&#8217;ll make sure that essentially the first template covers. The post status template and I need to replicate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like I said I&#8217;ve been hacking away at the Sitewide version, and so I&#8217;ve done this a couple of times. I just need to copy all my updates over to the post version. And then you&#8217;ll have all the same features on for sitewide images or for post specific images. And then we&#8217;re, and then you can at least start messing around with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:43:43] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Do I need to do a little bit more work for you, like sh on the post templates, take a podcast or whatever content we have and think through. I&#8217;d want to quote from here. I&#8217;d want the summary slide for here. Do you want me to do a little bit of that work? [00:44:00] Like with live action stuff and Google Slides?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:02] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yes. Like the more work you do thinking through these templates, I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;re gonna I&#8217;m not gonna be able to deliver most of it tomorrow, but we can create one, yeah. Or we can create the one that&#8217;s similar to the Sitewide business card that just covers your basics. It&#8217;s got a logo, it&#8217;s got the title.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it, and then you like, cuz I wanna get this to you so that you&#8217;re like, you are pub, you publish and you&#8217;re like, Hey Corey, I&#8217;m trying to publish this for tomorrow. I need X, Y, Z. I&#8217;m like, okay, now we have a real world scenario, let me go add that. Here&#8217;s&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:41] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> what I&#8217;m gonna do. Then I&#8217;m just gonna think about, I get one featured image template thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. And to just showcase the value of the post. And and work on a couple of thoughts with, I&#8217;ll take one post and start doing it. Maybe take another [00:45:00] one and start doing it, and then deliver that and go, Hey, I think these are the basics for that one thing. And that gets me huge way into showcasing the value post and everything else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like you said, it&#8217;s crazy. Yep. With that. So I&#8217;ll&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:14] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> do that. And then like I said, I mean we&#8217;ve I&#8217;ve set up the technical side of serving, of selling this thing using e D on the website. Yeah. So we need to start thinking about a homepage, cuz we&#8217;re not gonna be selling tomorrow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you and I both know that the first version is 10 versions, in a day, or, in, within a week before we actually let something stay online. Yeah. We wanted you sent over a design you like and then we&#8217;ll but we need some words to start putting on that page. So start thinking about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. So&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:58] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> really for me it&#8217;s [00:46:00] homepage and the post template.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. Can do. Awesome. Love it dude.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:08] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Thank you. We&#8217;re so close. We&#8217;re so close.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:12] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah. Too, and I love the way we&#8217;re doing it. It&#8217;s like we have a live action thing that we&#8217;re making it better and I&#8217;m putting on the hat of actual users cuz I am Right. Helping formally, I think that&#8217;s such a good way to do product that sometimes has been a mismatch for me, but I&#8217;ve got the live action, thank you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:31] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Great.

Users are getting closer to a more unified content editing experience with the addition of the Pages menu to the Site Editor. Clicking on Pages will load the ten most recently updated pages with a link to &#8220;Manage All Pages&#8221; at the bottom of the list. Users can quickly jump into editing content by selecting a page.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The interface also includes a little reminder about the nature of pages in WordPress: &#8220;<em>Pages are static and are not listed by date. Pages do not use tags or categories.</em>&#8221; It will be interesting to see how page editing in the Site Editor is received, whether it is too confusing for users to understand what they are editing, or whether the baseline expectation is that content can be edited anywhere. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Revisions for design changes have landed in 15.8 with <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/50089\">a basic UI inside the Global Styles panel</a>. It shows a timeline of saved changes along with who made the change, so users can easily revert back to previous design changes. This creates an extra cushion or safety net for those who are designing their own sites and should provide a greater level of user confidence when making design changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Version 15.8 also introduces <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/50030\">theme previews for block themes</a>, a feature that has been sorely missing for early adopters of block themes. This is made possible by a new <code>theme_preview</code> parameter, which allows the user to see what the site would like if a different theme was active.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few other noticeable changes in this release include the following: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Post Featured Image: New design for Replace and Remove buttons. (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/50269\">50269</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>More intuitive Details block with summary and innerBlocks content. (<a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/49808\">49808</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li>List View: Allow dragging to all levels of the block hierarchy.

This was the company&#8217;s first block theme on WordPress.org and it is already active on more than 1,000 websites. Building on the success of this theme, Shufflehound has created a child theme for agencies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lemmony Agency bears a strong resemblance to its parent theme but with more agency-specific patterns. This theme ships with 25 new custom block patterns, on top of the ones already included in Lemmony, for a total of more than 50 patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The patterns unique to this theme suit agencies but would also work well for non-profits, advocacy, portfolios, or businesses of any kind. These include a hero with services, accordions for things like FAQ, counters, more pricing tables, services with icons or images, a blockified sidebar, testimonials, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The theme&#8217;s creators have done an excellent job in organizing all the patterns available to users. Inside the pattern explorer/inserter, they have been separated into different panels for the patterns specific to the Lemmony Agency theme, the Lemmony patterns, and the Lemmony full-page patterns. This makes it easier to build pages, since users won&#8217;t have to hunt through all the patterns lumped together.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The Lemmony Companion plugin, recommended when users install the theme, adds a handful of custom blocks that some of the patterns rely on to work. It includes blocks for a counter, icon, post featured image caption, typing text, hero auto-slider, and accordion. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>This might be the best way to ensure these features are styled exactly to match the theme and give users more creative control inside these particular blocks. Sometimes using third-party plugins to add sliders or icons can look like it&#8217;s bolted onto the design in an unsightly way. A companion plugin designated specifically for this theme makes sense in this instance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shufflehound made an interesting choice creating Lemmony Agency as a child theme of what is already a very flexible multi-purpose theme. This certainly could have been shipped as full-page pattern but it would have also greatly expanded the patterns packaged with the parent theme. In these early days of block theming, it&#8217;s not yet clear what users might consider &#8220;pattern bloat&#8221; or too many patterns, especially since they can easily be categorized under various panels inside the explorer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/lemmony-agency/\">Lemmony Agency</a> is a solid option for building websites that need to showcase their services, display pricing, or simply maintain an informational web presence. It&#8217;s available for free from WordPress.org and will auto-install the parent theme at the same time.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 22 May 2023 20:35:03 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:9;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"WordCamp Central: SiteGround joins the WordPress global community sponsorship program in 2023\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:39:\"https://central.wordcamp.org/?p=3165350\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:118:\"https://central.wordcamp.org/news/2023/05/siteground-joins-the-wordpress-global-community-sponsorship-program-in-2023/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2491:\"<p>Please join us in welcoming <a href=\"https://siteground.com/wordpress-hosting.htm\">SiteGround</a> to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/sponsor-multiple-wordcamps/\">2023 WordPress global community sponsorship program</a>!

I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Intro continues)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today we&#8217;re gonna spend a little time talking about WP Playground. This is a project that debuted at State of the Word in December 2022, but it was demoed for me about a month prior in November.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was, and remain, absolutely floored by the potential future applications, as well as the innovative thinking behind it. So I&#8217;ve invited a couple of excellent WordPress futurists to the show today so that we can listen in on their conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Welcome guys.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Rich Tabor 00:01:07]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hey everyone, I&#8217;m Rich Tabor, and I&#8217;m here today with Adam Zielinski to talk about WordPress Playground. So for those of you who don&#8217;t know what WordPress Playground is, can you tell us a little bit more about it, Adam?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Zielinski 00:01:18]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Absolutely. WordPress Playground is WordPress that works in your browser like there&#8217;s no server with PHP or database like there&#8217;s just your browser and JavaScript, and you can run it in so many more places that we’ll all get to. For example, I just came back from WordCamp Gliwice, where on a Contributor Day, a couple of developers got set up with WordPress in just a couple of minutes, whereas normally, it can take hours to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Rich Tabor 00:01:44]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s pretty impressive. Do you think that, particularly for WordCamps and other demo-type areas, this would be something that&#8217;s very useful? Or what do you think would be the other problems that could be solved with WordPress Playground?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Zielinski 00:01:55]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Playground solves one primary problem, and that is WordPress is pretty difficult to get started with. I&#8217;m not even talking about creating your website, but let&#8217;s say, someone told you there&#8217;s this WordPress thing that you should try. Well, you Google for it, and you find installation instructions, and there&#8217;s like three hours of work for you there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So then maybe you&#8217;ll find a hosting company, and you have to pay some money. So with WordPress Playground, you can actually try it for free because there&#8217;s no cost to run it. It just runs on your device. If you&#8217;re a developer, and you want to start learning WordPress, normally you have to go through quite an extensive setup process, and there are some tools to make it easier, but maybe there&#8217;s still friction like you have to even own a computer, like a PC device or a Mac. Playground can run on your phone, and it can power interactive tutorials that you can use and just start learning there and there with zero setup.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like if you work on a product team and someone asks you to test a code change, with Playground you can just click a link and test it with no infrastructure behind it. And if you&#8217;re a company creating a plugin, you can just show your plugin in a live demo to people. And this isn&#8217;t something many plugins are doing because it&#8217;s quite hard to get a live demo set up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Rich Tabor 00:03:12]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ah, that&#8217;s pretty impressive. So, you know, amongst like tutorials, code changes for developer environments, the mobile application running, do you think that, since there&#8217;s such a wide brevity of ideas that WordPress Playground can kind of plug into, would this be more of a developer tool?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is that right? Or is Playground more of a like a click and play-type application that can run anywhere and demo anything?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Zielinski 00:03:36]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s both, but it&#8217;s more transparent for the users. So there are a whole lot of things you can do with Playground as a developer, as I just mentioned. But who are you doing these things for? Well, some of them are for the users, as in live demos, or there&#8217;s a WordCamp Europe coming, and I know some people are doing workshops there. They are going to use Playground to get everyone set up. So now that&#8217;s, well, maybe a workshop that teaches you how to build a theme, for example, right? Now you can just get started without any setup process. So there&#8217;s both, it&#8217;s very useful for development teams, and it&#8217;s very useful for them to build stuff for the final users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Rich Tabor 00:04:21]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s great. I know you, and I have probably both been in the same scenario at WordCamps when you&#8217;re trying to get dev environments set up, and it takes, you know, the better half of the workshop to get to step one. So this is really gonna be interesting to see it, especially at WordCamp Europe, and to see it getting into action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are you planning on going to WordCamp Europe this year?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Zielinski 00:04:39]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Absolutely, I will have a table at Contributor Day, a WordPress Playground table. So yeah, everyone&#8217;s invited to come over. I&#8217;ll show you a lot of cool stuff. And then at WP Connect on Saturday at 10:00 AM, there will be a WordPress Playground session where you&#8217;ll be able to learn more and see some cool demos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this will be a conversational format, so we&#8217;ll just have a nice chat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Rich Tabor 00:05:01]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Super cool. So how else can people find out a little bit more info about Playground and perhaps even get involved and contribute to the project?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Zielinski 00:05:08]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a developer.WordPress.org/playground website. There&#8217;s a link in a show notes where you&#8217;ll be able, like this is the perfect entry point to the entire rabbit hole of WordPress Playground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a quite a few projects under the WordPress Playground umbrella, and they all live in a single GitHub repository where you can just find any issue that interests if you want to contribute and just start contributing. Also, there&#8217;s a Slack channel in WordPress org space called #meta-playground, and I highly encourage everyone interested in coming over to say hi.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And probably one of the best places to ask questions and get acquainted with the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Rich Tabor 00:05:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, that&#8217;s great; I&#8217;m very intrigued about the project overall. I think that there&#8217;s an immense amount of potential, for WordPress Playground. Just last question here, like, where do you see the future of this project going? What is the most interesting application that hasn&#8217;t been done yet, or the things that are really gonna be the next level in unlocking Playground for everyone?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Zielinski 00:06:12]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s quite a few. Imagine being able to go to WordPress.org and have a WordPress demo right then and there without having to download anything. Then you customize it, and you have a button to host your website anywhere or just to download it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine having a live preview for all the themes and plugins in the directory and even in WordPress core, but these are sooner than later. Maybe like, let&#8217;s talk more grandiose, shall we? So there&#8217;s this term, 1 billion new users coming online in the next, like in the nearest future, and plenty of them doesn&#8217;t even own a desktop device. Maybe they have a mobile phone, maybe they have a tablet, maybe we&#8217;re talking about a young, prospective developer somewhere. And currently, if you don&#8217;t own a desktop device, you cannot contribute to the WordPress plugin ecosystem at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, we&#8217;re seeing more and more of creating themes with no code, which is really exciting. But you cannot build the plugin, really. Well, with WordPress Playground. Suddenly you can do development on a mobile device. So development tools and code editors and just the entire suite of things we use as the developers on our desktop of devices like this may come online and be available in your browser.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you&#8217;re on a train and you just have a phone with you, but you still want to learn, how to build a plugin, well, you&#8217;ll be able to do that. Furthermore, there&#8217;s a lot of exciting opportunities with ChatGPT, as in, well, here&#8217;s a WordPress running entirely on your device. So maybe if that&#8217;s connected to ChatGPT, you&#8217;ll be able to say, well, I like fish, or like, I want two columns and a photo of a racing car on top of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And because ChatGPT can output HTML, we connect the two, and suddenly, you can build a website entirely in your browser using natural language.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Rich Tabor 00:08:20]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Man, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s really interesting. It really does unlock the next, potentially the next like, wave of innovation in the WordPress experience, especially removing all the complications of getting set up and actually seeing what&#8217;s there. I think that it really could, be huge for users every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Zielinski 00:08:38]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, here&#8217;s one more. So, edge computing is big lately, and it&#8217;s going to be bigger in the future. WordPress Playground runs on this new technology called Web Assembly, and it just happened so that a bunch of edge computing providers allows you to run web assembly on their gear. So imagine having WordPress running entirely in edge infrastructure with no centralized server.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Truly decentralized WordPress. It could be big for a well cost of operating, but also for speed, but also even further down in the future. Imagine downloading the actual, you know, even WordPress around time to your device and having the entire website on your phone. So then you know, you&#8217;re on a train, you enter a tunnel, but you can still browse that WooCommerce store and add things to your cart even though there is no range at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Rich Tabor 00:09:32]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wow, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s pretty crazy. How far out there do you think something like that is?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Zielinski 00:09:37]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s hard to tell. I mean, technically, it is possible. There are a lot of challenges with regard to privacy, right? And data security for the edge computing case specifically. As for the development tools, there was a Cloud Fest hackathon earlier this year where I was with Daniel Bachhuber, also from Automattic, and we led this exciting project that brought the WordPress development environment into the browser using a couple of editors that are out there, and this is too much of an MVP for actual production use yet, but we got it working, and we build an actual plugin on a phone without internet access.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Rich Tabor 00:10:19]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wow. And that was just a hackathon, just hacking at it to see what you can get.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Zielinski 00:10:23]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, it was two and a half days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Rich Tabor 00:10:25]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, that&#8217;s awesome. That&#8217;s really cool, man. Well, this has been quite a pleasure. Thanks, Adam, for chatting all about WordPress Playground. Folks, just be sure to check out developer.WordPress.org/playground to explore, experiment, and play with WordPress Playground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This has been awesome, Adam.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Zielinski 00:10:43]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you so much for having me, Rich.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:45]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What a remarkable new way of working with and experiencing WordPress. I would love to be able to find ways across the project and ecosystem to help folks see what they&#8217;re getting into before they get into it, but also, who knows what the future holds for that project. Keep an eye on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>(Musical interlude)</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:10]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us to our small list of big things happening right now in the WordPress project. The first one is that the Kim Parel Memorial Scholarship for WordCamp US 2023 is open, and applications for it are the WordPress Foundation will once again be offering that scholarship for Travel to WordCamp US.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is for specifically for women in technology, women in the WordPress space. I&#8217;ll include a link to that in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is WordPress&#8217; 20th anniversary is still coming, as we heard in the last podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have reached over 100 events that are scheduled on or around May 27th, which is WordPress’ launch date. There is still time to find your closest location and attend one of those events. And probably, there&#8217;s also time to pull together an event of your own. Head on over to wp20.WordPress.net if you would like to see events in your area.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing is WordCamp US 2023. I realize WordCamp Europe comes before that, but the programming team actually has a really interesting thing that they&#8217;re doing this year. They have some changes to the way that they are organizing the event and finding speakers for the event. But as always, they are working very hard to make sure it is an attendee-focused event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m gonna include a link or two to some announcements that are really worthwhile there. Head on over to the podcast page to see those. And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing.

In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about WordPress Point Release, 6.2.1, Gutenberg 15.8, and of course the previous one, Gutenberg 15.7 as well, and some of the experiments featured hiding in the Gutenberg plugin. I&#8217;m your host, Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator of the Gutenberg Times and WordPress developer advocate, and a full-time core contributor for the WordPress Open Source project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m so happy to have, again, Fabian Kägy back on the show. It&#8217;s been a while since we talked and so much happened. We just found out, it was the episode 59 and it was in February 2022, well, it&#8217;s a whole world happened in between. So for our new listeners, Fabian Kägy is the Associate Director of Editorial Engineering at 10up and a core contributor to the Gutenberg project since 2017, I think. So welcome back on the show, Fabian. How are you today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: Thank you so much for having me. I&#8217;m excited to be back on this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re here. So I have to ask, editorial engineering, what does that entail at the agency 10up?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: So that is a special, in quotation marks, &#8220;made up role&#8221;, where I started down the path of a front end engineer and over time became more and more passionate about all things editorial experience. So that is now a special role where I get to focus part of my time on actually coming up with best practices and solutions for working with a block editor and helping the entire team level up and carved out my niche.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s awesome, especially because in view of the next phase of Gutenberg where it is actually all about collaboration on an editorial team, so making that a smooth experience is definitely something we all will be working on for when 6.3 come out, I think. Your input will be invaluable for your clients, as well as for the team, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: Yes. I&#8217;m very, very excited about all the things that are lined up for all of us to work on and to explore, and it&#8217;ll be fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So with the developer blog, I&#8217;m part of the editorial team that does reviews and works with writers. Once in a while, we start out with Google Docs and have everybody comment on it. Some writers say, &#8220;Well, I&#8217;m waiting for that moment where I don&#8217;t have to use Google Docs anymore to collaborate with people on a post and not have to copy/paste it over.&#8221; So we are very much looking forward to that collaboration and we will be eating the Gutenberg dog food, so to speak, on the developer blog.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Announcements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of the developer blog, Justin Tadlock just published the What&#8217;s New for Developers in May 2023 on the developer blog, and that&#8217;s a series of roundup posts that were started in February, where we look at all the publications that come out throughout the month, what&#8217;s new in core, the Gutenberg plugin, the keeping up with Gutenberg index page, and so much more, and just pick those things that are relevant for developers not to teach them how to use them, but more like, &#8220;Watch out, this is coming,&#8221; and prepare them for an X release pretty much.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The main one has quite a few items in there that are highlighted there. One is the Block Selectors API, which has definitely the markup of a larger tutorial, but it got quite a few developers excited about CSS and their blocks and being more in control of it. Another one as we will also talk about it is the first community theme and all things. So it&#8217;s pretty much a roundup of a lot of things that are interesting for extenders like plugins, developers, theme developers, and also agency developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we share the latest blog post link in the show notes, but if you haven&#8217;t looked at those yet, and if you&#8217;re a developer, subscribe to the feed of the developer blog or just for the roundup post so you get a heads up on many things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: I would highly encourage everybody to take a look at those because they&#8217;re super valuable, just quick shares of what&#8217;s going on, what are the things to look out for, and even if you&#8217;re not developing for the actual experimental Gutenberg plugin, it is something. It makes it so much easier when the next big WordPress update comes around to know what&#8217;s in the pipeline, what are the things that are being talked about and already have some grasp of just what&#8217;s coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, thank you so much. Justin does a great job in putting it all together and also shares some resources that are available on Learn WordPress. Then there were two new posts since we had the last show. There was one on how Webpack and WordPress packages interact by Ryan Welcher. That really gets you a little bit more theory around how WordPress and Webpack work together. For those that are not like me, I trust the things &#8230; I trust in God. I trust in things that if I put an NPM, run something, that it&#8217;s all going to work out, but some people want to really dive into Webpack some more and this gives them a great introduction to that. How are you doing with Webpack? Are you manipulating Webpack for your own development?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: So I used to do it a lot, especially in the early days of the WordPress Scripts package. There were so many things that were not yet a part of it, and I was very actively adding hacky solutions to add post CSS and all of those SaaS things to WordPress Scripts. That was my introduction to actually working with Webpack. Now, WordPress Scripts takes care of most of our needs or for some of the things, we have a similar tool at 10up that is a helper so we don&#8217;t have to deal with custom Webpack configurations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I read through that post from Ryan about how that interacts, and it&#8217;s a really solid deep dive. If you want to understand the areas, the inner workings of how some of these Webpack plugins interact, which you don&#8217;t need to, but if you want to, that is very, very useful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Then the other blog post was the per-block CSS with theme.json. The per-block CSS came out out of feedback from the community that custom CSS were not available anymore to put in custom CMS for the block themes and for sites, and it was introduced with 6.2, but it also needs some additional handle. Justin wrote a blog post about it, how best to think about per-block CSS with theme.json without getting too deep into the weeds and how that&#8217;s offered to the user. So definitely read up about it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the FSE program, Anne published two summary posts and you make your part of coffee first because they&#8217;re both very long but also very detailed from the latest testing calls. One was Build Your Block Theme with the great block theme plugin and the other one was the testing call 21 for the FSE program for the front page fund summary. There will be a new testing call coming out of the FSE program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you are into block themes and users use them and all that, it&#8217;s definitely a good overview on what are the pain points, what are the team working on because Anne is very, very thorough in adding to all pain points or discussion points, also the PRs or the issue that is on GitHub about that particular topic. So you can chime in with your opinions, with your experiences, and with your testing, and it would really help if you chime in and be encouraged to actually be part of the testing project. That&#8217;s it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of course, we share all the links in the show notes for this episode.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Community Contributions</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Another great announcement and community contribution is the first theme coming out of the community theme project where community members and team members are working together on creating block themes and the first one is called Stacks. It&#8217;s a theme with which you can build slide decks. It&#8217;s a very interesting approach to a website that is more a slide deck rather than have navigation from page to page to page. It&#8217;s more like a guided tool that you can use it or you can use it for your next presentation, but you don&#8217;t have to use a third-party tool for that if you want to spin up a website and just use it for your presentation.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s quite interesting to see how that comes together. The code is certainly available on GitHub and we share both the announcement post, as well as the write up by Sarah Gooding on the WP Tavern for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: These explorations and these themes and plugins that allow you to build your slide deck in the block editor, I&#8217;m always amazed when I see that. I think a couple of years ago, Ella was maybe one of the first ones who did talk at a React conference and blew my mind in the end when they revealed, &#8220;Hey, and all of this was created in the block editor and these slides are powered by it.&#8221; I think Nick Diego also did it at WordCamp US or at WordCamp and it&#8217;s always pretty cool to see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: You&#8217;re right. Nick Diego did it at WordCamp US for his talk, Build A Block in 15 minutes, and he built actually that slide back there as well. It&#8217;s very interesting how this can be used on your own website. Yes, Ella had a slide. It was actually a block that she added. I think it was the same for Nick Diego and now we have a theme for it. So it&#8217;s really cool.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What’s Released</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. That brings us into what&#8217;s released and, of course, let&#8217;s start with the minor release for WordPress, the 6.2.1 Point Release that just came out this week and there were a few hiccups there. Do you want to talk about this and what&#8217;s happening there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: Sure. So 6.2.1 was released, I believe it was at some point early this week. One thing, there was a security issue that the security team took care of and made sure that that gets resolved as quickly as possible, but that security issue essentially resulted in short codes no longer working in block templates. So in a block-based theme, if you have a short code inside a block template, that will no longer actually get converted to the dynamic data. That has caused some issues for folks, especially around auto updates because it&#8217;s just a minor patch release, but it is breaking some existing sites, which as always, it is a very difficult choice to make and a very unfortunate thing when that has to happen because of security thing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is an open issue in track where a lot of this is getting discussed right now, and it was discussed in the core chat yesterday, where essentially, it is very unfortunate when something like that has to happen. From my perspective, I think the team, if there is a security issue, that is the only thing that can be done. The only thing that I think we as a community can try to be a little better at is communicating those types of things ahead so folks are more aware of that, &#8220;Hey, we needed to make a difficult decision here. Beware, you should make this update, but here are some things that you can do instead to help your site still be up there,&#8221; because the communication around the issue could have been a little better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s no maybe about it, but it was a little obscure in the change log and it wasn&#8217;t saying, &#8220;Okay. It&#8217;s going to break sites,&#8221; but I think it&#8217;s really hard to also suggest a solution right now. So Jean Baptist Audras was one of the release leads together with George Mamadoshvilli, and he wrote in the core dev chat on Wednesday night, &#8220;The release itself went pretty well. Thanks everyone for your patience. However, as you may know, one security fix led to the important issues with the short codes used in templates, but it was not templates per se, but block templates in block themes. So the issue is currently actively discussed in the security editor team and some hypotheses have been made to sort this out in a quick followup release. No schedule is available right now because the discussions haven&#8217;t been finished yet, but it will depend on the followup patch currently discussed by the editor team.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to just point out, and Paul Byron had actually &#8230; All the solutions on how to deal with it right now in the emergency situation when you see dozens or even hundreds of page breaks, one is to roll back to 6.2 with a core rollback plugin, use the short code, and put them in template parts. That seems to be working in the block themes that you put the short code in a template part and add that template part to the template or have &#8230; In the ticket that you mentioned, Fabian, there were also a code example on how to introduce making the shortcuts work again, but all three of them introduced the security issue again.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m not sure quite how to advise people to work, but there are no good choices right now because you are caught between you want your client&#8217;s side to work, but you also don&#8217;t want their security issue to be out there too long. So the core editor team is definitely working on a solution to fix the security fix, but all, what I just said, is actually just introducing back the security issue into your sites.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are also opinions that short codes might be a legacy way of dealing with things. Maybe it&#8217;s a good call for converting the most important short codes to blocks and use them for the block editor instead of &#8230; but not everybody has the capacity for it, not everybody has the time for it or they&#8217;re just not there yet, but the plugins that they use are also not converting the shortcuts to blocks. So it&#8217;s the nature of the beast. I don&#8217;t think the shortcuts will ever go away, but there&#8217;s a better way to handle that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: Yeah, definitely. In regards to the various options that we have right now, rolling back and that plugin that exists and that code that you can add to your theme, those all add back the vulnerability, like you said. I wasn&#8217;t sure from my understanding whether putting the short code in the template part actually caused any issues. I thought that that was the best proposed solution even though it&#8217;s clunky to have to deal with template parts for those areas individually, but from my understanding, that was the best outcome where you&#8217;re not really introducing the security vulnerability, but also can retain your feature or the look of your site. So I think that is the best option right now, but yeah, it is a little opaque.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Good point. Thank you for pointing that out again. Okay. The rest of 6.2.1, quite a few bug fixes for core, as well as for the editor that were found during the release of 6.2 and didn&#8217;t make it into 6.2, but that&#8217;s why the followup release was really on the schedule relatively to the 6.2 release. We will also share the changelog for the release in the show notes, as well as the tickets for the discussion. Paul Byron also added that solution with the template parts to the ticket so you have it all in one place to look up for if you want to follow up on that.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Gutenberg 15.7</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. Next one up was Gutenberg 15.7 and it had quite a few enhancements. One is that as group and media texts have now allowed blocks attributes that can be passed to the inner block props, so to speak, that means that you can control which blocks can be added to a certain group or a media text block if you wanted to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: That is a really useful thing for extenders or theme builders or if you create a pattern that is meant to be a certain thing, you&#8217;re now able to restrict which other blocks can be used within that area, which can be super useful when you build a call to action and have some styling around that and don&#8217;t want to support a table to be in that call to action, for example. This is so useful to be able to do that. So we don&#8217;t have to build the custom block for it, but instead we can create a pattern and have all those options and can curate that editorial experience to really, the level that we want to curate it to. With the template and template block, we were able to do some things, but now with the allowed blocks, we have most of the controls of an actual inner block area also exposed for these blocks that support inner blocks, which is very useful, I think.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: Next up, we have the site logo added a replacement flow that allows you to change out the actual logo using the inspector control. That is just an addition, an alternative way that you can deal with the site logo essentially. You can still use the inline controls, but while you are in the sidebar tweaking your spacing or any other visual controls, you can also quickly swap out the media there, which I think is an interesting approach to this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For this one in particular, I&#8217;m interested to see the feedback around it because for the most part, we&#8217;ve been very strict about there should be direct manipulation of content right in the editor canvas and not many controls should live in the inspector controls. It&#8217;s not removing it from the inline, but it&#8217;s also adding that secondary way of manipulating it to the inspector controls. I&#8217;m very curious to see how that will play out and how that may affect just how we use this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So inspector controls is just another way to say sidebar, just make sure where those tools are when you first encounter them. I think it comes more like we want to be a parity with a customizer. That&#8217;s one more step. Then in the inspector in the sidebar, when you replace the media, you are going right directly to the media library and select that. So you don&#8217;t have to &#8230; It seems to be a slightly different workflow than it is from the toolbar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the next feature is actually a really cool addition or enhancement of the fluid typography. So when the fluid typography was introduced first in 6.1, it still had the problem that if you have very large fonts, they wouldn&#8217;t go small enough for the mobile version because the calculations would stop and it would still be too big. This feature introduces a logarithmic scale factor to calculate the minimum font size and now the font adopts to all screen sizes. Even if you have a 68 or 102 pixel font, it will scale down to a mobile version and not stop at 50 or something like that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: The next thing on the list here is the behavior of the top toolbar has been changed, and that is for a long time now you&#8217;ve been able to using that user settings menu in the upright corner change the behavior of the block toolbar to no longer be attached to the actual block, but instead always be fixed at the top of the editor. The behavior of that has been changed so that you can collapse that toolbar and still have it available there, but because the space in that top toolbar is quite sparse, that allows for just some more flexibility with how things are getting laid out there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a couple more things that we&#8217;ll talk about later that were changed about the overall layout of that tool toolbar. Actually, I like it very much the way that it&#8217;s coming together and with some of the explorations happening there. I really like the direction where a lot of this is going right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It also fixed &#8230; One particular thing that was still missing is that you now have access to the parent block, which on the block toolbar you were always able to select the parent toolbar and then the sidebar changed and everything. When you had the toolbar fixed on the top, you wouldn&#8217;t have that particular icon available to click on to manipulate the parent block. That has changed too, and it came in with that particular feature there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was always 50/50. Some weeks I like having the block toolbar right on the block, especially when I&#8217;m further down on the block page, and sometimes I just want it on the top and I&#8217;m changing it all the time. I don&#8217;t know how you do it. So I have not tested this new toolbar fixed setting yet, but I definitely will. I read through the comments and there are some discussions. So please add your feedback and your experiences to it and what you think about it to make it the best it can be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next is that the image block now also displays &#8230; No, it&#8217;s not the image block, it&#8217;s when an image is in a block or in a template, it now also displays the borders on the placeholder. So if you have a template that gives you all the series of blocks and each block you want the feature image there, you will also see now in the placeholder the color of the borders, including the color of it. So it makes your choices of images maybe even smoother. It&#8217;s very subtle, but it&#8217;s definitely a live quality enhancement that I definitely like because sometimes you just need to have a picture that does not clash with your borders if you had a design option that image has borders.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: It just makes your life a lot easier when you&#8217;re creating a template and you don&#8217;t &#8230; Before this when there was a placeholder where no actual image was selected for the post, it was just difficult to gauge, &#8220;Hey, how do these border controls actually affect this?&#8221; Having the placeholder resemble the actual image much closer and retain all of those border controls is just a very good thing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up, we have a change in experiment for the actual pattern insertion modal, which I am really excited about. When you use the pattern instruction modal, you know that all of the various patterns are displayed in a grid, and that grid can look a little weird sometimes because it&#8217;s very staggered how these &#8230; Some patterns are very tall, and then the next one is very narrow, very short. There&#8217;s a lot of white space in that modal. This option here tries a masonry layout where they actually &#8230; If you&#8217;ve ever used Pinterest, it&#8217;s essentially that type of layout where it just fills all that white space and it&#8217;s showing all of those, I think, in a more elegant fashion and it just makes that look a little more refined. I&#8217;m very happy to see that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s definitely a more natural look for the pattern modal. The next feature is that duotone block controls are now added to the sidebar. They were hidden before in the block toolbar and you had to know that they are there and the icon was a little bit obscure. Then the options when you do it in the block toolbar is it feels like you are in the wrong place to make those decisions, and now you can make them from the sidebar. I really like that. It&#8217;s a clear adoption to the interfaces that we saw from other design tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: Next up, in the accessibility section, there are some refactors of how the ARIA attributes for the list view have been modified, which makes it much easier and much more accessible to navigate through the list view. It&#8217;s always good to see those enhancements over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Those ARIA levels, there were quite a few in the list view, so there was a major overhaul of the display of the list view. I think Alex Stein did some great work there to make it happen and put it over the finish line.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m scrolling a little bit further down to the changelog and I have the feeling we are done with 15.7. It was a smaller release, but it had definitely some great features in there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>Gutenberg 15.8</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>We are now coming up with 15.8. Fabian, you were the release lead on that. Do you want to kind of kick it off and let us know what&#8217;s in there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: Sure. So there were a couple of major features which get their introduction here, which is always fun. One of them is the addition of a command center. There actually is &#8230; There was a post on the make blog from Riad that I&#8217;m sure will get added to the release note or to the podcast notes here that explains a little bit more in depth what this command center actually is. Right now, it is an experiment, but it essentially like spotlights on a Mac, for example, or some of these launchers. You have a quick keyboard command. In this case, it&#8217;s command K, to launch essentially, an open prompt field where you can put in your prompts and jump to different places of the editor or create new pages or just perform quick actions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s also meant to be extendable and meant to be something that plugin developers can hook into and allow users to actually quickly navigate their site and perform actions. I&#8217;m really excited to see if this comes to life and explore how this ships out in the future. With this feature, I&#8217;m so here for it, I&#8217;m so excited about it. I cannot wait for the day where this gets expanded outside of the editor view and is just available in all of the screens of WordPress because right now, it is limited to the editor screens, but I think in the future, this will be available in all of the pages of the admin of WordPress. I&#8217;m so looking forward to that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Riad&#8217;s post on the Make Core Blog &#8230; Blog and block, sometimes I get it mixed up, but I did it right this time. It&#8217;s the Make Core Blog. It&#8217;s called Command Center and Request for Feedback. So he explains what the prototype is. There&#8217;s also a small little video that quickly shows you how it works and then explains the API and the static commands and also what dynamic commands are, definitely, and the contextual commands. So there are three commands that you can have it use, but it&#8217;s also the extendability in mind for plugin developers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it also triggered a few things. If you want to employ an AI to use within the block editor, having a standard interface that can call AI commands is certainly beneficial to the editor. So as Fabian said, I will share the post in the show notes so you can chime in and see what you think about it and how it works. It&#8217;s really hard to describe on a podcast, audio podcast, for that reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: As somebody who has championed extensibility and plugability in the editor for such a long time, I&#8217;m so happy to see how this feature is getting rolled out and how it is built with that extendability and plugability from the very beginning. So I&#8217;m really excited about this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: If you want to try it, it&#8217;s still behind the experiment flag. You need to go to install the plugin 15.8 and then go to the Gutenberg menu on your WP admin and then there&#8217;s an experiments page and you need to check the mark for the command center to actually be able to test it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next item on the list is a new feature as well, and the first version of the revisions UI for the global styles, so all the talk about global styles and new features and new options to change things. Some people want to try just something out and then revert to the previous version and there was no revision available for the global styles. Now, there is, and it has actually some nice features. When you have the site editor style, the style site open and click on the revisions, it will show you a history of the revisions, and when you click on the items, it will show you a version of it on the canvas and you can also compare versions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think it&#8217;s getting there. It definitely needs some more refinement in terms of what information will be there, how many revisions are we showing, and all that. So that&#8217;s a really interesting progression on this global styles editing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: If you&#8217;ve ever used revisions of a standard post or a page since the block editor was introduced, this is a great feature for global styles and I think it&#8217;s the right thing to roll it out for this first, but the live preview of a revision in a rich preview makes me so excited for a future where we can eventually get rid of the existing code view of revisions for standard post content stuff and actually show rich previews of that because, especially since the introduction of blocks, the revisions UI is just really, really difficult for non-technical people and even technical people to really manage because you just get a code view and are trying to figure out what changed.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This year is a visual preview of what revisions look like for global styles and it&#8217;s making me so excited about what&#8217;s to come for more other visuals or revisions in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I totally agree that revisions for the posts and pages are on the board for the collaboration project, the phase three of Gutenberg and making revisions be aware is definitely something we are all looking forward to.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: Next up, we have the inspector panel. So again we&#8217;re talking about that right-hand sidebar of the global styles panel is now getting or got a refactor to make it work and look more similar to how it works on the standard post. I think that for a long time had been an area of confusion for me where if you wanted to change the typography options or color options in the global styles, the interface was just structured completely differently to how it is structured when you just select a paragraph block, for example, in the standard editor. This is unifying those two experiences to be alike and that just lifts a whole bunch of cognitive load that you have to think about and just makes it work the same way in both of those areas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Excellent. In the same way, there is now a details block. We talked about it on the show before. That is in experiments and it now has been enhanced to be able to use InnerBlocks in the details of the spoiler alert block. I call it spoiler alert because the detailed summary that&#8217;s as broad idea that some people don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re talking about, but you have a sentence or just a headline, and then you get an arrow and then it reveals additional content. You can use it to talk about spoilers in your book review or in your film review or you can hide details that only a certain amount of readers will need about a technical thing or so. In the earlier versions, you only could add a paragraph to those details or only paragraph blocks and now you can add images, you can add quotes and all that. So this is definitely an enrichment of the details block. Also an experiment though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: That is really something &#8230; I know I have been involved with those conversations of the details block for way too long already, but I&#8217;m really looking forward to getting the community feedback of just what&#8217;s available there. It&#8217;s a very difficult thing because the detailed summary is essentially an accordion, but there are some accessibility issues that make it not the best use case for an accordion. So with these changes, just I&#8217;m interested in the feedback of the community of how they&#8217;re able to use all of the design tools to make it function the way they want to or whether there are struggles because this changes a little bit of what was there before and there were some more design options that you had with that earlier approach, but it also was a little less intuitive because it had more levels of nesting and the summary element was its own block and was just more complicated, and this is a much simpler implementation of that block. Also, it therefore removes some of the options that you have available. I&#8217;m really interested to see how that plays out and what people will think about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Many, many, almost all block collections that came out when the block editor first was released had an accordion block in there. A lot of people liked it for FAQs and for how-tos and all that, but it was interesting, I really didn&#8217;t really know why there wasn&#8217;t an accordion block in core until I read through the discussions about the details and summary. Some people will make it work as an accordion, but what the accordion does, it knows about the other block. So you have an accordion. The first is the tab on top and then you have details and then you have another tab and then the details and each accordion knows about the other one being open or not open. That&#8217;s very hard to replicate in a model way how the block editor works.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tested the details in summary block that&#8217;s in the experiment right now with 15.8 and I didn&#8217;t find it particularly easy to navigate because it had some hiccups. I don&#8217;t know how to get out of it. Normally, if you have a list block, when you hit enter twice, you&#8217;re out of it and then you can add additional blocks to it. There are no visual cues when you are in the block writing or adding additional blocks. There are no visual cues, are you still in the details section or are you not? The summary, there is no way to get from the summary to the details block per keyboard. You need to change controls on it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are a few things, but that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s behind the experimental flag and not yet completely released. So do as a favor and enable that test, that experiment so you can also test it. As Fabian said, community input is wanted and necessary.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: Next up, there is another addition to the site editor and that is in the main sidebar of the site editor. There now is a new menu item called Pages that allows you to view the 10 most latest edited pages of your site and directly jump in and edit them. That is one step of actually making content editing in the site editor more possible. Again, that was one of the features that was there in earlier revisions of the site editor but then got taken out before it got released in I believe it was 6.1. These are explorations of slowly adding that content editability back into the site editor. It&#8217;s really interesting to see how that works. It is so difficult how to best communicate with the user when you&#8217;re editing parts of a template versus when you&#8217;re editing parts of the actual content of a page.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that that will still be the most difficult issue to solve for here, but this is slowly introducing that back into the site editor and it is really cool to see just having all of those things in there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Look at the menu item on the left-hand side, as other people say the dark side of the site editor, but it&#8217;s there. So the next item or feature that got introduced makes Fabian really, really happy and it&#8217;s the introduction of the plugin template settings panel slot, which means on the sidebar, there is now a way for plugin developers to extend the feature set that&#8217;s displayed to the user. Have you tried it out yet? Have you looked at that feature?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: I&#8217;ve not yet had a chance to play with it, but yeah, more slots and more places for extenders to add to the experience and showcase custom settings and those types of things always make me happy, especially when they&#8217;re done right, and this seems pretty cool.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next up, we have an update that is very useful for extenders again. It consolidates and adds some more documentations to the storybook. If you&#8217;re not familiar with the storybook, that is actually something when you go to the GitHub repository of the Gutenberg plugin, in the right-hand sidebar there is, I think it&#8217;s called pages or deployments. You can actually jump to that storybook right from GitHub and view it. The storybook essentially is showcasing all of the various React components that were built as part of the Gutenberg plugin and are available in WordPress core and is showing live previews of them with some controls. You can tweak some of the settings right there visually and also have some of the documentation there. This consolidates and changes a little bit of just how that is structured and how that appears. Just in general, the storybook that has been there for a long time is a super valuable and great tool and it&#8217;s always nice to see additional enhancements for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I definitely want to point that out that at WordCamp Asia, I heard from a few people that were at the contributor day and working with the core editor table there, they were really surprised that many developers that came and wanted to work on things did not know about the storybook. I think we have not done a good job in explaining what it is and pointing people to it. I think it&#8217;s part of the documentation that is in the components, but it&#8217;s not referred to &#8230; Most of the time, it&#8217;s not referred to in the documentation on the developer site in the block editor handbook. We are going to change that a little bit and add more links to the storybook for the various components because it&#8217;s such a rich developer experience where you can change things and then you click on a button and it gives you the code for it for the changes that you made and you can immediately reuse it in your own code base. Definitely, I take any chance when I can talk about the storybook now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next part is a feature for the block editor that is talking about the dimension controls and it&#8217;s not always visible. So now, it&#8217;s an attempt to show all the dimensions control at the beginning and not hide them so much where you had to open them and then decide do you want to see the padding, do you want to see the margin. It&#8217;s now easily available so you don&#8217;t have to look for it, what padding and margins is, because we all talk about padding and margins, but we never talk about dimension controls. So when the words appear on the screen, you don&#8217;t as easily recognize that that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re talking about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: This, again, is also something where it is just difficult and interesting. The vertical space that we have available in the sidebar is very limited and it&#8217;s always an interesting balance to strike of how much do we show by default versus how much do we hide behind the setting so it&#8217;s not overwhelming for somebody that is new to the editor, but also makes it discoverable for somebody. So it is not changing any of the features that are available, but it is trying to show some more by default. I&#8217;m very interested to see how folks will react to that, whether it feels overwhelming or whether it makes it more approachable. The only real way to find that out is by actually testing that. So I&#8217;m glad to see those explorations happening in the plugin.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It might go away again or will be tweaked later on. So your comments are certainly wanted and necessary. We share in the show notes the release post for 15.7, the release post for 15.8. By the time you listen to this, Fabian will have published it, and I&#8217;m sure also, Sarah Gooding will talk about both releases or already has on 15.7 and 15.8.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><strong>What’s in Active Development or Discussed</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>or I just wanted to at the end of it &#8230; So those were all the releases and we are now talking about what&#8217;s in active development or discussed. We have right now the largest number of experiments in the block editor since the beginning. I think there are now seven experiments hiding on the experiments page for the plugin. So let&#8217;s talk about them. Some of them we already talked about. So it starts out with a zoomed out view and it&#8217;s test a new zoomed out view on the site editor. So I&#8217;m reading from the page now and it also has a warning attached to it, &#8220;The new feature is not ready. You may experience UX issues that are being addressed.&#8221; UX means user experience, just to clarify that. Did you test that before?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: Yeah. So the zoomed out view essentially means that you can more quickly navigate through or get a more holistic view of your page and not appearing in the same size as you would always see it, but instead, it zooms out and shows you more of your entire page smaller in the canvas. That is very useful when you want to make changes to your global styles and just want to see how it affects your site more holistically or when you tweak those things. Especially when you switch between block theme variations, that is just useful to see how it will not just affect that very small area of the site that you see in your viewport, but instead see it more broadly for an entire page.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think this is a great thing to work on. Right now, as the warning says, there are some issues that are being worked on. Especially for working with global styles, having that more zoomed out view is very useful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So if you tested it and you have an idea how to make it better, definitely air those on GitHub and filing an issue of that. So the second one, it says color randomizer, test the global styles color randomizer, a utility that lets you mix the current color palette pseudo- randomly. I think it&#8217;s one of those features where it said, &#8220;Okay. It&#8217;s cool to have and cool to test things out, but it&#8217;s not something that a lot of people would think they needed.&#8221; Do you have any thoughts on it?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: It is one of those features where from my perspective as somebody who works a lot in the large agency space, that is not a feature I would&#8217;ve ever come up with, but I can see how, especially if you&#8217;re somebody who&#8217;s just playing around in the editor trying to build a new design, it can be a useful partner to give you some inspiration of maybe you&#8217;re not the best with color theory and coming up with an accessible color palette yourself, and that can be a great way to get some inspiration for just showing you different variations of what your site could look like with different colors and spark some of that imagination, but it is one of those features that I know for a client site that has a design guide with strict color I would want to disable that feature and would not want to expose certain clients to that feature. So it&#8217;s definitely one of those where I can see it being useful for some, but also rather distracting for others. So I&#8217;m interested to see how that will actually get rolled out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It might also be part of the explorations, but the design team does in figuring out is there a way to include different palettes that are on third-party sites that can come in and you can choose from, but I think it&#8217;s not a high priority right now for the team. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s all still in the experimental phase and it hasn&#8217;t gone that route yet. I heard Matt Mullenweg and one of his state of the word talking about making color palettes that are out in the universe interesting, available to site builders or site owners in some way or shape.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third test item on the page is the command center, a test of command center, open it up using command K in the site of post editor. We talked about it. I don&#8217;t think we need to elaborate some more, but that&#8217;s where you find it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fourth one is the grid variation for a group block, test the grid layout type as a new variation for the group block. Right now, that only works on the site editor because it&#8217;s actually a template or site design approach to the grid. Grid, it&#8217;s actually a CSS feature. So this tries to explore how you can make templates that adhere to a certain grid layout, but I&#8217;m not as knowledgeable about design to be able to use that. I think I need a little pre-beginner&#8217;s tutorial for that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: It is. I am really happy to see this exploration being done right now. In the last couple of years, we got that row and stack variation of the group block, which essentially as a developer, that is my flex box. Flex box allows you to layout content in one direction, so either horizontally, the row, or vertically with the stack. The grid, you can achieve some of those grid layouts with the columns block, but the columns block, it is very difficult for it to wrap around. So if you wanted to, let&#8217;s say, have a three column grid that is not just one free column layout, but instead has two rows of those two columns, that is not really or is technically possible, but it is not ideal. That is where grid layouts come into play and are, I think, so much more powerful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think there also is an exploration that is not listed here of adding an actual grid layout or using CSS grid layout for the grid in the query block. We weren&#8217;t able to use grid when the editor first came out because it was too new of a CSS feature and we needed to support more older browsers, but that browser support has changed so much in the last couple of years that we&#8217;re now able to use grid in the editor. It just opens up so many new design possibilities and makes it so much easier.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll say on the custom development side, grid block is one of the first things that we build on one or a grid block is one of the first things we build on many custom sites because it is just much more powerful than the columns block and also easier to use in a way. So I&#8217;m excited for these explorations.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will say though, a couple of releases ago, the group block changed to show that variation picker when you first insert it where you have to pick between the variations. I&#8217;m not yet sure I&#8217;m in love with that approach of &#8230; I like the various variations of the group block, but when I add a new group, it always pauses me a little too much because I need to step back and, &#8220;Hey, I just want to start with a default grid or a default group and then continue with it.&#8221; So I&#8217;m happy for more of these variations of the group block and for more of those layout controls. I&#8217;m not quite sure we have found the best way to expose them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I hear you. Making the decision to use a group block now becomes also a decision of what kind of flow you want and you are not there yet. When you get the group block, I understand that, but I&#8217;m also excited for the grid layout in terms of it is a feature that was requested quite a bit in the early days of the block editor layout site editing things, and it&#8217;s still missing. So now, certain plug-ins and block collections and theme collections have stepped in and allowed that already. So core is a little bit behind on that, but of course, core has a different outlook for the site editor than plugin developers have.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fifth experiment in the experiments page is the details block with the detailed summary block. We talked about it. It&#8217;s there for you to test out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The sixth one is the block theme previews, and it enables block theme previews. That&#8217;s not much of an explanation, but what it allows you is on your site &#8230; So the customizer had the live preview of themes that were already installed on your site so you can see how your site would need to change to when a theme would be activated. It&#8217;s more a decision making tool rather than a good design tool.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So with many, many block themes coming online, we are now beyond 300 in the directory. I think the largest number is 306. I think it helps with the decision if you want to change your theme out to have a better preview, and the customers that preview doesn&#8217;t work with it. This is the first iteration. I ran that through themes through the preview and it was a great experience, so much better than the original one to review certain parts of an existing site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It also revealed that not all block themes are alike. There are significant differences, and having a tool to actually explore those differences or even notice them is invaluable, definitely. Not every theme behaves with this live preview feature in it, so if you are working on themes and either you have a starting theme in an agency or you use a collection of themes to build your sites to choose from, you might want to test them with this theme preview so you can turn on and off features and showcase a few things that are available in the preview.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, please, please comment on the issues or file issues on GitHub after your tests. I already found one that when I look for style variation and I want to see how a page changed the style variation, I don&#8217;t have a way to do this because the page that is linked, the link doesn&#8217;t go to the preview, it goes to the page in the template editor, and all of a sudden, I&#8217;m out of my mindset on a preview, but all of a sudden it gets me into the editor. So that&#8217;s common for things that are in testing, but it also needs to be pointed out that that&#8217;s a major stumbling point for someone who uses the feature for the first time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last one of the tests has just come in. It&#8217;s a navigation block that uses the still in Experiment interactivity API, and I have not used it. Did you look at that, Fabian?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: I looked at it briefly, but the summary of it is if you&#8217;re using it and you notice a difference that worked before, there&#8217;s a bug because this essentially swaps out the engine, but you should notice it as an end user. It changes how the front end JavaScript of the site works to use that interactivity API, but instead of some custom JavaScript that was purposefully written for this, using that interactivity API to make it more declarative, but as an end user, toggling that setting should not change anything about it works. Yeah, it may produce the actual bundle size, therefore make your site a little bit faster, but usability wise, there should be no difference and there should be full-on feature parity with how the navigation works today before or after you switch that setting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Good to know. So if you don&#8217;t notice anything, it&#8217;s okay. Excellent. So this brings us to the end of the show today. Well, I think we talked a lot about all the new things that come to block editor and to WordPress. Thank you so much for joining me today. Fabian, is there anything that you want our listeners to know about the block editor, about WordPress, about 10up? Now is the chance to talk about it and we&#8217;ll add links to the show notes. I just wanted to say about 10up, you have a wonderful educational site about the block editor with quite a few white papers and tutorials. How did that come about? Is it your work or…?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: Yeah. The <a href=\"https://gutenberg.10up.com/\">gutenberg.10up.com</a> website, our block editor best practice site has been my baby for the last year and a half or so, where I got to spend a lot of time actually writing down how we as an agency approach working with the block editor and setting up the best practices for how to do that in the agency setting for that special type of client. Whereas the main documentation of core is more geared to end users, which is the right thing, but because of that, we decided that there is space for an additional resource to focus on the things that are important for those very curated experience for big clients and so forth.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that is one thing that I would mention, just taking a look at that <a href=\"https://gutenberg.10up.com/\">gutenberg.10up.com</a> website, and if you have any feedback on that, feel free to reach out anywhere on the Make Slack or on Twitter or Masévon or Blue Sky or wherever you can find me pretty much always talking about block editor stuff.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then the other thing that I will just mention is the 10up block components NPM package, which is my passion project and has been for the last three years or so, which essentially is a collection of React components that work like all of the WordPress packages, the WordPress components, WordPress block editor components. It is a collection of additional components that are adding sometimes very complex, sometimes easy functionality for you to build. If you build custom blocks, making that a whole lot easier so you have to write less code and know that it&#8217;s tested and is working with the way that it should, and doing that in a way that feels 100% like it is just core WordPress. I&#8217;m very happy and proud of that project. If you find it useful or if you have questions or feedback about that, always happy to chat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Well, thank you so much. There&#8217;s some great resources. You mentioned custom blocks. There has been discussion around static block with this dynamic blocks. Where do you land?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: The way I think about it, if I&#8217;m building a plugin that is meant for the official directory where I as a developer do not have access to the site where the code is running on, I would go with a static block unless I need to show dynamic data. If I as the developer can access and have maintenance over the site I built dynamic blocks, and that means in the agency context where we&#8217;re often changing designs, making quick iterations, we are, for the most part, only building dynamic blocks because of that because we cannot spend the time to deal with deprecations and all of those things.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It really comes down to that where if you have &#8230; The thing that you should ask yourself is, &#8220;What should happen when I need to change something about this block on a code level? Should all of the old instances that maybe were published three years ago, should they also get those updates automatically or should I not &#8230; Should that historical content stay untouched and just stay the way that it was?&#8221; If it should stay in touch, static blocks is your right answer. That is the way to go. If it should update in all instances or if you need to modify the block structure very often and have access to the maintenance there, dynamic blocks are much easier to deal with and are &#8230; So I&#8217;m coming down most of the time on the dynamic side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Dynamic blocks side. All right. So well, thank you for answering these quick questions and having some insight in how you work as a longtime block editor adopter and in the agencies. It was a great pleasure talking to you, Fabian. We will share all the links that you mentioned, of course, in the show notes. Before we end the show, oh, what&#8217;s your Twitter handle, Fabian?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Fabian Kägy</em>: My full name spelled out, so F-A-B-I-A-N-K-A-E-G-Y, just all spelled together. You should be able to search for it and it should come up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s just for the people who don&#8217;t go through the show notes. We, of course, have all the links in the show notes. As always, the show notes will be published on gutenbergtimes.com/podcast. This is episode 83.

Version 6.2.1 was also an important security release, but due to the catastrophic breakage for those using shortcodes in block templates, some users were implementing insecure workarounds or simply downgrading to 6.2 to keep critical functionality working on their websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress contributors worked quickly over the weekend to ensure that users can now update to 6.2.2 with their shortcodes intact. The release post identified the removal of shorcode support in the previous release as &#8220;a regression&#8221; and a bug. This is an important recognition, as shortcodes are still a tool that users frequently rely on to insert functionality from plugins that haven&#8217;t made it available as a block, as well as a necessity for things that won&#8217;t work without inline shortcodes.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Version 6.2.2 is also a security release, as core contributor Jonathan Desrosiers said that the issue patched in 6.2.1 &#8220;needed further hardening&#8221; in this update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users are advised to update immediately and automatic updates are rolling out. Many reported having turned automatic background updates off for core after 6.2.1 broke their websites. Users who did so will need to manually update as soon as possible. </p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 20 May 2023 21:38:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:13;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:118:\"Gutenberg Times: WordPress 6.3 roadmap and release squad, WPCampus schedule, Wayfinder and more—Weekend Edition #254\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/?p=24143\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:124:\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/wordpress-6-3-roadmap-and-release-squad-wpcampus-schedule-wayfinder-and-more-weekend-edition-254/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:24428:\"<p>Howdy, </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hubby and I are almost settled in our new apartment, except we are still missing our furniture.

(May 17)</a>, Kägy highlight three new features that need testing from Gutenberg plugin users: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/05/17/whats-new-in-gutenberg-15-8-may-17/#add-the-pages-menu-to-the-site-editor-50463\">Add the pages menu to the site editor</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/05/17/whats-new-in-gutenberg-15-8-may-17/#add-revisions-ui-50089\">Add revisions UI to the global styles interface</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/05/17/whats-new-in-gutenberg-15-8-may-17/#add-theme-previews-for-block-themes-50030\">Add Theme Previews for block themes</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li>One feature is now still listed in experiments. It will come out next Gutenberg plugin release: The Command Center AKA Wayfinder. (See Riad Benguella&#8217;s post. )</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s always a great pleasure to connect with <strong>Fabian Kägy</strong>. We had a great time geeking out over the blog editor while recording episode 83 of the Gutenberg Changelog. We discussed Gutenberg 15.7, 15.8 the feature available on the Experiments page and 6.2.1, Gutenberg Storybook and 10up tools. The episode  is at the editor now, and it will arrive in your favorite podcast app over the weekend. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-light-background-background-color has-background is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p><strong>🎙️ </strong> New episode:  <a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/podcast/gutenberg-changelog-82-gutenberg-15-6-and-proposed-schedule-for-wordpress-6-3/\">Gutenberg Changelog #82 – Gutenberg 15.6 and proposed schedule for WordPress 6.3</a> with Birgit Pauli-Haack and special guest Nick Diego</p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/riadbenguella\">Riad Benguella</a></strong> published the post <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/05/17/command-center-request-for-feedback/\"><strong>C</strong></a><strong><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/05/17/command-center-request-for-feedback/\">ommand Center: Request for feedback</a> </strong>asking for testing and review of a new feature that will come out of the experimental phase for Gutenberg 15.9, for now called the Command Center, and the Marketing team is probably recommending a new name: The<strong> Wayfinder. </strong></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\" id=\"0-p\">Plugins, Themes, and Tools for #nocode site builders and owners</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Caroline Nymark</strong> published an <a href=\"https://fullsiteediting.com/site-creators/introduction-to-the-site-editor/\"><strong>Introduction to the Site Editor for creators</strong>.</a> This tutorial is meant for Beginners and no-code creators and covers everything available since WordPress 6.2 and Gutenberg 15.7.

It came recently out of beta and offers developers a whole range of design tools in an interface that has been built on top of Gutenberg, yet using custom components to offer additional design features. The plugin comes with hundreds of icons, patterns, templates and sixteen custom blocks. The Pro version is available at <a href=\"https://maxiblocks.com/\">MaxiBlocks.com</a>. It&#8217;s meant for designers looking for all the tools, not so much for beginners or site owners.

The TL;DR: &#8220;Using the Site Editor alongside the Create Block Theme plugin supercharges the experience, mainly by filling in gaps around font management and offering more nuanced creating/exporting options. With these added features, the Site Editor is both left to shine as a theme building tool and the current known pain points impacting regular site building come to the surface, like needing more clarity around where layers of styles are coming from. In general, feedback fell into three categories: Create Block Theme plugin pain points, missing options in the Site Editor (font management, synced patterns, desire for more styling options with certain blocks), and UX considerations for the Site Editor that match the site building experience. &#8221; she wrote. The videos shared from the contributors are certainly eye-opening. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikemcalister\">Mike McAlister</a></strong> explains in his article how <a href=\"https://olliewp.com/a-native-and-iterative-approach-to-responsive-control-in-wordress/\"><strong>a native and iterative approach to responsive control in WordPress</strong></a> could bridge the gap between the goals to rely on <a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/news/2023/02/intrinsic-design-theming-and-rethinking-how-to-design-with-wordpress/\">i<em>ntrinsic design</em></a> and still be able to handle edge cases for viewpoint-driven responsiveness of a site. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>In his video, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zh0ANsYgoN0\"><strong>WordPress Gutenberg Product Manager explains what&#8217;s next for Responsive Websites and Block Themes</strong></a>,  <strong>Jamie Marsland</strong> interviewed <strong>Rich Tabor</strong> on intrinsic design, what a theme product might look like for theme creators and what the next wave of block building inspiration might arrive at the WordPress shores. </p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://twitter.com/jkoussertari\">James Koussertari</a></strong> explained <a href=\"https://gutenbergmarket.com/news/using-layout-sizes-in-themejson\"><strong>Using Layout Sizes in theme.json</strong></a>. &#8220;The layout setting in theme.json is great for developers, as they can set default container sizes for their design system, easily in one place. It also means that content editors do not have to think about which container sizes to set manually each time they add a block.&#8221; he wrote on the blog of the Gutenberg Market</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity is-style-wide\" />\n\n\n\n<p>The latest call for testing ended last week, too and <strong>Anne McCarthy</strong> recounts the feedback: <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2023/05/11/fse-program-front-page-fun-summary/\"><strong>FSE Program Front Page Fun Summary</strong></a>. The high-level feedback revealed: &#8220;In general, the call for testing was relatively tame bug wise, with only a few obvious ones found, mainly in the Navigation block. The usability feedback related to many ongoing projects in the Site Editor underscoring the impact of solving these consistent problems, in particular the clarification of the content &lt;> template relationship and confusion around the overall experience of managing pieces of navigation. &#8221; and &#8220;While the new Grid layout type was the primary focus of the testing call, feedback on it was limited to suggestions for consolidating the various options between the grid layout, Columns block, Gallery block, and Table block.&#8221; McCarthy wrote. </p>\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/references/keeping-up-with-gutenberg-index/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">&#8220;Keeping up with Gutenberg &#8211; Index 2022&#8221;</a>&nbsp;</strong><br />A chronological list of the WordPress Make Blog posts from various teams involved in Gutenberg development: Design, Theme Review Team, Core Editor, Core JS, Core CSS, Test and Meta team from Jan. 2021 on.

The feature was <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/gutenberg-15-6-introduces-experimental-details-block-and-command-center-for-site-editor\">introduced in Gutenberg 15.6</a> under the Experimental flag and currently has limited use in the Site Editor context while navigating and editing templates. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Command Center project is intended to be expanded to the whole of wp-admin in an extensible way so plugin developers can register their own commands. This would also allow for AI-powered extensions to expedite design, content, and layout creation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;One aspect worth highlighting is the proposed API to interact with the command center,&#8221; Gutenberg engineer Riad Benguella said in <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/05/17/command-center-request-for-feedback/\">a post requesting feedback on the project</a>. &#8220;The command center has been developed as an independent <code>@wordpress/commands</code> package. It offers APIs to render and register commands dynamically. These extension points allow plugins to inject any commands of their liking and opens the door for interactions with LLMs.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Benguella shared a video of the prototype navigating between templates and template parts in the Site Editor:</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>Feedback so far had been generally positive, but contributors on the project will have the challenge of providing real examples of the Command Center&#8217;s benefits in order for some to fully realize the vision for this feature as more than just a fancy shortcut for power users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Neat, but I’m unclear what practical problem this actually solves?&#8221; WordPress developer Jon Brown said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Currently there is a clear easy to find and use drop down at the top center of the editor. Are people really having problems using that? This seems to complicate things where users have to know the names of the items to type them in. Does the average user know to type in &#8216;post meta&#8217; to edit that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There are couple plugins that have done this admin wide, which again while neat, seems better aimed at power users that already know what they’re looking for.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Benguella responded that the Command Center is being developed as &#8220;a complementary UI tailored specifically for average and power users,&#8221; and that users would not be required to remember technical terms in order to use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other participants in the conversation asked that contributors consider not releasing the Command Center in WordPress until it can serve contexts beyond just the Site Editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Initially we’ve added the command center to both post and site editors but I expect that we’ll be adding to all WP-Admin once we’ve proved its behavior and APIs,&#8221; Benguella responded. The API is currently still in the experimental stage in Gutenberg and it&#8217;s not yet known if expansion to wp-admin would be added before or after the Command Center lands in the next version of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Love the concept, hate that it’s limited to the Editor,&#8221; WordPress developer Dovid Levine said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This would ideally be implemented holistically – either as part of a push to modernize the long-neglected dashboard or API efforts to interact with GB data outside of the Editor. We’ve seen how slow developer adoption is when done the other way (GB first/only) – and worse, how painful it is for the early adopters/advocates if/when considerations beyond the Editor are finally taken into account.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first milestone, powering quick search for content and templates in the editor, is <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/48457\">outlined on GitHub</a> where contributors can track the progress. The Command Center will also be tested in the future as part of the FSE Outreach Program. Benguella is <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/05/17/command-center-request-for-feedback/\">requesting feedback</a> on the feature and its API on the post published to the core dev blog, specifically regarding the user experience and whether the APIs detailed in the post are capable enough to address third-party use cases.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 18 May 2023 21:13:38 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:133:\"WPTavern: WordPress’ 20th Anniversary, a Mini Series.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case the 20th anniversary of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today is a little bit of a departure for the podcast. It&#8217;s an episode all about the last 20 years of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re going to hear a round table discussion with four WordPressers talking about their thoughts on the last 20 years. It features Sarah Gooding, Aurooba Ahmed, Masestro Stevens and Jess Frick, with David Bisset as the discussion moderator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They cover many topics, and it&#8217;s great to hear so many varied opinions about what&#8217;s been of importance in the evolution of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you, David Bisset, Sarah Gooding, Aurooba Ahmed, Masestro Stevens, and Jess Frick. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Well, welcome everyone. Uh, thanks for coming. This is the one of a few podcasts to celebrate the 20th anniversary birthday, christening, whatever it is you want to call it, of WordPress. Uh, yes. 20 years old. That&#8217;s it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s just barely attending college at this point. Isn&#8217;t that great? We have four sweet people with me here that I wanna introduce tonight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are going to do a, kind of like a news draft. So we are going to pick the favorite WordPress moments of a couple of categories, and we are going to pick them so that if, um, So if somebody picks something that, that, that the another person had on their list, that person that comes after them is gonna pick something different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you&#8217;re gonna hear unique things coming out of every one of our guests this evening. So let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s start our introductions. By the way, random.org picked our, picked the order. This is going in so that I am not playing favorites. Aruba, you are first on our panel. Tell us about yourself. Hi everyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aurooba Ahmed: I&#8217;m excited to be here with all these lovely people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m Aruba, I&#8217;m a WordPress developer. I build plug-ins, websites, all that kind of good stuff. And I&#8217;m up here in, uh, by the Rockies in Calgary, Canada,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: the Rockies. All right. Next on our list is Sarah Gooding. Hello, Sarah. How you doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarah Gooding: Hi, David. Thanks for inviting me. Um, I&#8217;m Sarah Gooding. I&#8217;m the editor at WP Tavern.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been there, it will be 10 years in September. Um, I live in Florida. I moved there two years ago, um, during the pandemic when my husband&#8217;s job changed and we moved down here and yeah, still love WordPress. After 20 years</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: you&#8217;re well working. Yeah. You know what, um, Aruba, how long, when did you first, uh, get into WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aurooba Ahmed: Um, I would, I think it was 20, it was 2008 or 2009.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Okay. So about, about the same time as me. So I don&#8217;t know, somebody will do the math in the second. Sarah, how about you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarah Gooding: I think it was around 2006 for me, but that was maybe just like trying it out. Okay. So like, um, when I started working in WordPress, it was 2008, 2009, so that&#8217;s when I started in years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Making websites for clients and. Things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: So, uh, yeah. So like, so Jess, you are up next. Can you tell us in your introduction to how long, at the end, how long you&#8217;ve been with WordPress? Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jess Frick: Uh, I&#8217;m Jess Frick. Thank you for having me, David. Um, I am director of operations for Pressable, and I have been playing with WordPress since 2008, working professionally in it since 2010.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Wow. It&#8217;s 2010, so we are, so it&#8217;s the oldest I, I&#8217;m per, well, I&#8217;ll introduce myself a second. Maestro. Yeah, you&#8217;re up, you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re fourth, uh, in the order. It&#8217;s chosen by random.org. So why don&#8217;t you introduce yourself, sir.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro Stevens: This is random.org that you keep pointing to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Yes, I am not. Thank you, David.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro Stevens: Yeah. Uh, my name is Maro Stevens. Um, I guess I am the preemie, the youngest person on this panel when it comes to WordPress. I started my, um, Uh, WordPress Journal in 2018.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Maestro, can you put yourself a little bit closer to the mic?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can you hear me? Can you hear me better now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A little bit better, right? Guys?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Girls? Mm-hmm. People. Humans. Yes. Okay, go ahead, Maestro. I&#8217;m sorry. So, yes,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro Stevens: I started in 2018. Um, so I guess I&#8217;m the youngest person on the panel when it comes to WordPress and uh, I&#8217;m an agency owner of the Iconic Expressions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Great. Well, yes, young, young Whippers now, but, but that, that does give us a perspective though, cuz us old timers like to, like, to remember the, the good old days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we need, we need some young blood. Um, so let, oh, that makes me fifth in the, in the rotation. In case you don&#8217;t know me, um, consider yourself very fortunate, but for those who may want to learn more about me, I&#8217;m David Bisset um, I&#8217;ve been worth, I think I&#8217;ve been with WordPress since about 2006 or 2007 ish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, 2008 is when I founded with some help. Where? Camp Miami. So I was with about WordPress for about a year and a half prior to that. So that&#8217;s kind of like how I do the math. Uh, I currently work at Awesome Automotive. I currently had a project, uh, WP Charitable, um, which was required by Awesome Automotive last year, but it&#8217;s a, but for the longest time I have been a freelancer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve been a employee, uh, employee and owner of a number of companies. Um, also a member of, uh, uh, post status. So I&#8217;ve been doing, I do, I&#8217;ve done a whole bunch of things. So that is our panel for this evening. Um, so why don&#8217;t we get started? And again, we are looking at the last 20 years of WordPress. So when, so that is certainly a lot of history to cover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course some of you are gonna be aiming for certain years and others will be aiming for others. So I&#8217;m gonna be very surprised tonight if any of us snags someone else&#8217;s picks in terms of news. And what we have this evening is that we actually have three categories that we are going to try to cover this evening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, I kind of, I usually don&#8217;t like to give categories or, or, or themes per round. If we have time after these three, we&#8217;re gonna do arou, uh, I&#8217;ll bring out your dead or, or, or whatever is left in our pockets type of a thing. But I thought with 20 years of WordPress, That is so, um, that is so broad to cover that I, it was almost impossible probably to, I wanted to make it a little bit competitive, so I kind of narrowed little things down to at least three categories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first category that we&#8217;re gonna cover is a, a memorable WordPress release or something within a WordPress release, any WordPress release. Then that was our first thing that we wanted to cover. So, Aruba, let&#8217;s start with you, um, category WordPress releases. So what, what was your pick for your memorable WordPress release in the last 20 years?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aurooba Ahmed: That would be Thelonious WordPress 3.0, which was really the first WordPress release that I paid attention to when I first started using WordPress. And it made a big splash in the world of blogging. I remember there was this really big blog called A Beautiful Mess. They came out with this course called Blog Love Design, and it was all about like using the new 2010 theme, which is when those, you know, 2010, those style of theming for default themes started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh. And using that to customize it and uh, create something really cool and you could now create custom menus for the very first time. And multi-site was merged. I mean, it was a really, really intense release that paved the way for a lot of what we think of WordPress, like core default. Of course WordPress has this sort of features, you know, but before that it didn&#8217;t have them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: I totally forgot about multi, uh, multi-site. Um, and I, and I didn&#8217;t know that three cuz remember prior to that, um, it was two separate products, which was kind of weird. Yeah. Right. If you wanted WordPress, it&#8217;s weird, you wanted to download WordPress, fine. But if you wanted to download WordPress M U.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was a separate download</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aurooba Ahmed: and it was like a whole thing to try to set it up. And with WordPress 3.0 it became a lot easier to make the switch if you ever wanted to turn a single site installation. It&#8217;s, it was still a process, but way easier with WordPress 3.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Who remembers, who remembers WordPress when that came out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jess?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jess Frick: Oh yeah. Aruba skunked me on the first one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Oh really? Yes. You got sniped. Really? You were gonna pick three? Pick 3.0 Wow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jess Frick: It&#8217;s literally the first one on my list.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aurooba Ahmed: Oh. Milestone release. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jess Frick: Incredible taste</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: and, and a nice round number too, which for WordPress you can&#8217;t always guarantee. Right now there&#8217;s another round number that I&#8217;m not gonna talk about that, that&#8217;s probably pretty significant too, but, okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Aruba Robot, WordPress 3.0 is your, is your first pick what in a snipe right out of the gate. So congratulations on that. Alright, so Sarah, you&#8217;re up next, me and, um, your memorable WordPress release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarah Gooding: I think probably one of the most memorable ones for me was 5.0</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: and that&#8217;s the other one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarah Gooding: Yeah. Um, 5.0 is such a, a big release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, Especially leading up to it, all the agencies and freelancers are trying to get their themes and plugins ready so that they&#8217;d be ready to go with the, you know, with the latest and greatest that WordPress had to offer. And it was such a, it was a big leap. Um, and then the, the timing of the release was like right at WordCamp us, and I think it missed some of its, its dates and so they had previously identified, um, like, if we missed this date, we&#8217;re gonna push it to January so that we&#8217;re not doing the release while everyone&#8217;s traveling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then, um, Matt switched it, I guess at the last minute. He&#8217;s like, no, we&#8217;re going for it. And yeah, there was this up, there was just, you know, a, a huge outcry with, you know, people who were frustrated and they&#8217;re like, why do we have to push it so hard? And it was just, it was like, It was like giving birth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think, you know, it was, you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re just going through this process and it was, of course, it&#8217;s gonna be difficult at times. And, you know, eventually everybody&#8217;s on board and everyone&#8217;s working together, um, releasing their tutorials, their open source stuff to help people, you know, get on board with the block editor because it was, it&#8217;s probably the, the largest technical leap that our communities had to navigate of, of all time, I think I would say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, it was an exci, it was really exciting time. I mean, I was, every day there was, there were articles to write about what people were thinking and feeling at the time, and there was a lot of frustration, but also it was, uh, it was just something that needed to happen because our editor had been, had been looking dated for so long and we needed to make that big jump.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think that&#8217;s probably one of the most reme memorable ones for me in, in recent memory.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Yeah. I&#8217;m gonna go on, on a limb. For me personally, say that was probably the most controversial WordPress release. Period. Yes. I, I worked for a plug-in company at the time and I was literally making changes to our plug-ins release to get into the repo in the ho in my hotel room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ll just kinda leave it at that in terms of how much stress that, uh, and I think a lot of people were doing pretty much the same thing. So I have to say that I think, uh, the number one most stressful word press release was for me, 5.0. Uh, I can&#8217;t imagine it was probably stressful for Matt and everyone else too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most controversial though, I think, at the very least for, for that. And I think it&#8217;s still 5.0 down to this day. You just remember the, the nu the version numbers just branded into the My brain, so 5.0. All right. Great. So now it&#8217;s gonna get interesting. Sarah. Swipe my number two. So Jess, um, can you think of a enough it literal second one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Poor Jess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jess Frick: I just wanna say though, for, you know, WordPress three, what was cool was the, the editor changed. Mm-hmm. And that was what made me go full-time and WordPress. That&#8217;s when it started to be pretty enough for me to play with it. Purdy. And then it was pretty though, and it got prettier. Um, I have a note here that it was 3.7 when WordPress became the most popular CMS in the world,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: huh? Accord, according to Matt,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jess Frick: uh, according to WordPress history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Okay, that&#8217;s fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jess Frick: Um, I think it was built with, it was through, built with. I&#8217;ll take</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: their word for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jess Frick: I&#8217;ll find the link for you for the show notes. But yeah, that, I thought that was significant because that was just when I feel like the entire editing experience changed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, But then also agreed for WordPress five. Um, I remember, uh, WP 1 0 1 was one of the big sponsors, and they pulled out of the show because they had to redo all their videos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarah Gooding: It was, it was chaos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: So, to be clear though, yes. Are you picking which WordPress version are you picking? Or have you</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jess Frick: Well, they, those were my two.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Oh, those were you too. Okay. I&#8217;m sorry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jess Frick: Talking points, but since I can&#8217;t pick either of those, I&#8217;m gonna say the first all women and non-binary release of 5.6. Ah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jess Frick: That I feel like we&#8217;ve got another one coming up too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Mm-hmm. Yes. We can&#8217;t talk about the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jess Frick: That&#8217;s, I know we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re looking</p>\n\n\n\n<p>back right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re just looking back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Yeah. So WordPress 5.5 0.6 was a major milestone too. In terms of, in terms of that. And I think it&#8217;s set, set pretty much a, an example of how those are going to roll in the future. Like we have a second one coming up. Um, did anybody here participate in that? No. Okay. Kind of, well, we kind, we were rooting for the side, but there was, there was so much diversity in that release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was, I was very glad to see that, not, not purely from a diversity angle, but as much as just there was excitement and contribution in general because of that. Yeah. And the more that you can expose contribution in general, I think the better off the WordPress project is even when we quote unquote went back to, after that, we went back to, I, for lack of a better word, a normal release or a, a standard release theme, which is no theme at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s basically, I went say hand. So Jess 5.6, excellent choice. Maestro, we come down to you. I, I I, I w I&#8217;m very interested to hear what your pick&#8217;s gonna be cuz this, these were the top three I could think of off the top of my head. But, uh, go ahead. I haven&#8217;t been sniped officially, but, uh, because I knew there were gonna be people that picked it anyway.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Maestro, what is your favorite, or what is the most memorable WordPress release for you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro Stevens: I feel like I just got sniped right now. Um, two times. Uh, Jessica hit one on the head, um, and you kind of was alluding to one, but I&#8217;m gonna go with 5.5. If we gonna go with points. Let&#8217;s go with the point system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m going with 5.5.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Okay. Um, that, that&#8217;s a, that&#8217;s a release. Points of releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro Stevens: Points of releases, right? The point of release. Yeah. So, oh, I&#8217;m gonna take a different direction and go with 5.5 because it was, it was a release that I felt affected a lot of people&#8217;s reason for, you know, being, uh, hired or paid for maintenance because it involved auto updates and once that came out it screwed up a whole bunch of people&#8217;s, you know, um, source of income or reasoning or opportunities because I know there was a lot of resistance and pushback when people were saying, well, I don&#8217;t need you anymore cuz I can auto update my own site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, um, that&#8217;s what I would say was one of the biggest ones for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: I, I actually had someone who went along that same path, but fortunately they used, they used bad plugins, so they&#8217;re, so they turned those auto updates off pretty quick. It actually reminded me, and I don&#8217;t know what version to this is off the top of my head, but I remember when auto updating WordPress itself was a big controversy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and I don&#8217;t, I&#8217;ll figure it out what the version that was, but I remember na for you, for those of you who may remember Nathan, he&#8217;s still with us. He&#8217;s just not with the WordPress project anymore. Directly for over like a year and a half explaining the concept of WordPress auto updating on major versions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a lot of. Controversy, um, pushback a little bit in terms of do we want to auto update this much of the web? So I, so I can understand that for plugins, right? You know, I, you know, it&#8217;s, I think it&#8217;s taken time because people paid for WordPress updates too. Like, they&#8217;ll just say, Hey, can you just update?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, you know, they would probably update the plugins at the same time. So, yeah. But you know what, I think in this day and age, there comes a time to evolve. I don&#8217;t think, I think auto updates aren&#8217;t on many sites for very good reasons, especially probably governmental and educational sites. But 5.6 auto updates did cause a blip in the timeline, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s a good choice. I think that&#8217;s pretty good. And I totally actually forgot about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aurooba Ahmed: So I, it was WordPress 3.7 when WordPress could auto update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: See that? That to me would&#8217;ve been my second choice because it&#8217;s now, now, now it&#8217;s, I guess it comes down to me, my turn. Um, that would&#8217;ve been my second choice because I remember going to so many conferences going to the conference in Arizona, that name, now I&#8217;ve Page Lee conference and I&#8217;m forgetting in the loop.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, no, it&#8217;s, although they think they talked about it there as well, but, um, yeah, I&#8217;ll think of it in a second. I&#8217;m just drawing a blank. Uh, it&#8217;s, it was PressNomics. PressNomics. There you go. Um, I think it was PressNomics, but I do remember attending a couple of conferences and Nas was there on stage or something, trying to explain how they have been talking to a whole bunch of people about WordPress updates and auto updates and people were scared, so, uh, not scared, concerned, whatever word you wanna throw at it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And everything&#8217;s fine now. So the plugin thing is gonna stray now, but, Because remember, I&#8217;ve been with WordPress a long time. I noticed no one went back to the one point WordPress releases. So I&#8217;m going to pick WordPress 1.5, which which came out in February, 2005. That release came with pages, comment, moderation, tools, and Kubrick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does anybody remember Kubrick? Maestro? You probably don&#8217;t. That&#8217;s okay. But Kubrick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro Stevens: Stanley Kubrick. Stanley Kubrick, or</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: the theme was named after him, but Google Kubrick and turn on Google images and you&#8217;ll see a blue. What the internet basically looked like in terms of blogs for like, for like seven years, cuz everybody was using Kubrick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, when WordPress came out, this was before like the two thou, the, the, the year themes came out. You&#8217;ll see it, you&#8217;ll see it. Um, it, not only that, but it also came with a new theme system. That&#8217;s when WordPress themes came out in WordPress, 4.1 0.5. And Matt announced themes with these words. And I quote in WordPress 1.5, we&#8217;ve created an incredibly flexible theme system that adapts to you rather than you expecting to adapt from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can have your entire web log. Remember those words, run through a single file just like before, or you can literally have a different template for every single different category. How far we have come from a site editor today, from to February, 2005 when WordPress 1.5 came out. I mean, for me, Paige&#8217;s was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The biggest deal, um, because I, and this is the version by the way, that I actually jumped on board WordPress full-time with, was WordPress 1.5. Um, coincidentally because I think prior to that I was trying, I was just at the point when trying out other brow browsers, it was movable type. There was PHP, nuke, I forget what else was out there, but like, I needed something, but I didn&#8217;t need a blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I needed something to build a client&#8217;s website with. And you really couldn&#8217;t do that without pages. So when 1.5 came out, pages was the chef&#8217;s kiss back then, really young chef&#8217;s kiss back then. So anyway, my pick is WordPress 1.5, so that was round one. A little bit of more, uh, sniping than I thought was was gonna happen.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But let&#8217;s go ahead and just not waste time and moved around. Two, our round two category that, uh, we picked out was, um, I think most memorable WordCamp. So just to clarify this for the audience, um, this could have been a work camp experience or it could have been the, the work camp itself. Maybe, maybe the atmosphere around it, the community around it, whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, as long as it was a memorable, your, your most favorite WordCamp. Memorable experience. So, Aruba, we&#8217;re gonna start with you on this. Sure. And if anybody gets sniped on this, I&#8217;ll be blown away. But go ahead, Ruba. You go ahead. Start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aurooba Ahmed: Okay. I&#8217;m not sniping anyone with this one. I&#8217;m pretty sure. No, I&#8217;m like a hundred percent sure it would be word pit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordCamp Calgary. So my hometown&#8217;s WordCamp in 2016, which was the very first time I spoke at a WordCamp. And it was also the first time I realized that WordPress was more than just software. There was this whole community around it. And the vibe was, I. Like it was more about more than just code. There was a lot more going on underneath the surface that you might not know unless you are participating in these kind of community events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and I feel like, and it could just be because that&#8217;s when I entered the time, but that&#8217;s when community efforts really started to become more of a thing in WordPress world. You know? Uh, I think work, the first WordCamp US was just like a year before that and, you know, things were starting to gain steam.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for me that was a very, very memorable time, very personally. And if it wasn&#8217;t for that WordCamp, I don&#8217;t even know if I would be here in on this podcast. So yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: I&#8217;m looking at the 2016. It&#8217;s, the theme was make period WordPress, period. It&#8217;s sing period. That was the theme of the camp. Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aurooba Ahmed: Because our Calgary theme for that year was music.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. We had a city theme going on that year for a lot of stuff. And so the WordCamp, um, sort of theme sort of fed into that as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Make sure to include all, make sure when you provide me the links for all your items to include the mm-hmm. URL to the work camps. I&#8217;m assuming that, assuming that there&#8217;s still exist, this one does, uh, work camp, work camp, uh, websites were so, so straightforward and simple back in 2016, which Oh yes, is really, to me, that&#8217;s not that far.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s not that far ago. I&#8217;m getting old. It was a two day event on May 28th and May 29th, 2016. And this was your first, I didn&#8217;t even have a avatar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aurooba Ahmed: I didn&#8217;t even have a avatar at the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Do you remember your talk? They don&#8217;t have your gra Yeah. Your avatars missing. Yeah. Do you remember your talk?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aurooba Ahmed: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the time, uh, it was, I think it was on theme development using Git. So like how to push your theme from your local environment to your hosting environment. But with just git, you know, deployment was not like a very sophisticated thing in the WordPress land at that time. Um, and I was using get hooks to create this sort of custom workflow so you could like push everything up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s what I did my little talk on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Yes. It took a while to find it because shame on them. They&#8217;re schedules are graphics on the WordCamp website, so I couldn&#8217;t search through text. They&#8217;re JPEGs, so yes. Shame on you. Yes, they&#8217;re shame on you. All right, so hey, we were learning, we were learning. Moving, moving, moving on here before anything Sarah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what is your, Sarah, what is your. Best or most memorable Word, camp moment or work workout? No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarah Gooding: Does this, this include, does this include WordCamp announcements or just like major announcements that were done at WordCamps? Or does, or is it just meant to be your favorite?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Most memorable. Most memorable to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And some people can take that is, I was there when this historic thing happened, or, you know, something personal to you. Now keep in mind our, what our next round will be, which I won&#8217;t spoil. So if it&#8217;s more closely related to that, then that&#8217;s the only thing maybe. But you know, I&#8217;m putting you on the spot here, I realize.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So just go ahead and share. As long as it&#8217;s, um, legit, legit work camp event. I, uh, event of some sort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarah Gooding: My first WordCamp was WordCamp Vancouver in I think 2012. And I was a speaker there. It was a, it was also a buddy camp. And so I was speaking about Buddy Press and I think I talked about like how you could add little jQuery animations to make it cooler.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I hardly, I can hardly remember because I was so hungover. Um, oh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: I just, oh, what year was this? What was the year was this year? This was 2012. Oh, so this was before the ch before the child.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarah Gooding: Oh yeah, before I had kids. And then I think the next year was Buddy Camp Miami or was that 2014?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Oh, don&#8217;t, don&#8217;t even get me started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarah Gooding: And I brought my dog to that WordCamp and it was my first time in Miami and somebody offered me like a hundred thousand dollars from my dog, or they offered my husband and he wanted to say yes and, but he knew that I&#8217;d be so angry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Um, I can see why that one came in second place though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarah Gooding: Yes, buddy Camps were my first entrance into Ward Camps and those were the ones that I tried to make it do and, um, really enjoyed the most.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meeting all the people I&#8217;d met through, uh, buddy Press and in the forums and contributing and I miss. And, uh, those were very memorable for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: I miss Buddy Camps, so if anybody who doesn&#8217;t know what a Buddy Camp is, is basically like a conference within a conference for Buddy Press. If you don&#8217;t know what Buddy Press is, go to buddy press.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s software that&#8217;s still maintained by, officially by Automatic. It is a social platform. It is the sister project. I, I&#8217;ve always considered it&#8217;s sister project of BB Press, which is a form plugin, but we don&#8217;t go into that. But yes, we did. I forget we had for one or two years Buddy Camps in Miami too, but Vancouver 2012 where Sarah gave her first talk, can&#8217;t remember it cuz the brain cells are destroyed, so she&#8217;ll, we&#8217;ll have to take her word for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s great. That&#8217;s, I always like it. What was, what was your favorite WordCamp? The one I can&#8217;t remember. Dude, well, I</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarah Gooding: remember, I</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: remember it, but alcohol poisoning here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarah Gooding: I met so many people there for the first time I met Matt Mullenweg, j Tripp, and you know, like there were a bunch of lead developers there just back then, like not, you know, the work camps weren&#8217;t huge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They were really small and it was exciting to, you know, meet the people who were working on WordPress. For real.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Yeah. Back then, the WordCamps were so few and far between when you went to one, chances are most of the core contributors we&#8217;d be there. You know, it was because we had to travel. Um, and the website is just as does still exist, October 13th, 2012, 8:00 AM to 5:00 PM at a, at Barnaby campus, Bernabee campus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, and by the way, when, when, if you&#8217;re listening to this, go look at these, um, old work camp websites, links that we&#8217;re sharing because you want, I&#8217;ll, you&#8217;ll get a kick of the people that we&#8217;re sponsoring them too. And their logos, if they still exist today, you get to see their old logos and if they don&#8217;t exist, you get to see who was uh, sponsoring work camps back in 2012.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, Sarah. Yeah. Work Camp Vancouver gets my thumbs up because it&#8217;s got a buddy camp attached with it. Eventually we will get to a work camp in the us. So Jess Jessica, is that gonna be you? It&#8217;s gonna be me. Okay. We&#8217;re, what were camp is most memorable to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jess Frick: So I actually went outside the box on this cuz I didn&#8217;t know how it was gonna play out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I&#8217;m coming at it from a different side. Favorite themes and the swag that got away. Favorite themes? Hmm. Favorite themes. I absolutely loved WordCamp Orlando. I&#8217;m a fellow Florida in here, Uhhuh. Um, I absolutely loved WordCamp Orlando 2015, which was Harry Potter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then 2018 was space with nasa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cool. So, yeah, definitely my favorite word, camp themes. But then the swag that got away, I wanna honor you, David. It was those WordCamp Miami lunch boxes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jess Frick: Oh no, you&#8217;re gonna tease me with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: I&#8217;m telling, find it in a second now. You see, I&#8217;ll find it in a</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jess Frick: second. All the cool swag everybody has.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And those were the ones that I was like,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aurooba Ahmed: oh, I don&#8217;t know where,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: where they&#8217;re within or where somewhere. Yeah, I, I will put a link, I&#8217;ll put a link in the show notes, but I&#8217;ll send it to you. I, we actually have a, um, I have a picture of them on my old blog. Um, so if anybody&#8217;s wasn&#8217;t aware, so I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m confused.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the Harry Potter one is the, is the one you want, right? Is is your pick. Right. But you&#8217;re</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jess Frick: Well for theme,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: for themed. Oh.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jess Frick: For theme the way that you, you know, cuz most of the WordCamps will have like a cool theme. And so obviously I&#8217;ve gotta stick with my hometown glory and go, you know, Harry Potter versus NASA Thai.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but for the swag that got away, definitely WordCamp Miami.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: We had an eighties theme that year. That&#8217;s why the lunch boxes Yes. It back you. I&#8217;ll see it, I&#8217;ll see it in a second.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jess Frick: Um, it was like a Miami Vice thing, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Yes. There were multiple lunch boxes, so it depended on what you saw. We, we kind of put a lot of, um, not to turn this into Work Camp Miami discussion, but we put a lot of Easter eggs into our work camps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if we have a theme, it&#8217;s like, if you didn&#8217;t see the one sponsored poster of the Breakfast Club, then you. Didn&#8217;t you, you wouldn&#8217;t have known about it, and it was just special for that. But yes, so I, you know, we can only pick one. So I&#8217;m putting you down for Orlando 2015, but I&#8217;m very honored that your, that your backup, that your second place was WordCamp Miami. I&#8217;m, ooh, where? Camp Miami. What year was that? I like to say it was 2018. It was 2018 was it? I think for our 10th year. Um, yeah, but I was supposed to be there and I wasn&#8217;t. All right. Well, Maestro, uh, so far nobody&#8217;s hopefully taken your picks. So, um, what would, what WordCamp would you put up as your, as the one that you, uh, remember fondly of?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, wait, we can&#8217;t hear you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro Stevens: Since I never technically attended a WordCamp. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: not even virtually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro Stevens: So I spoke at Work camps virtually in 2021, but I didn&#8217;t attend work camp as a attendee.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Were you a ghost?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro Stevens: But I&#8217;m gonna take it to the left a little bit. Um, I would say no, I was not a ghost.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Okay. But you attend if you spoke, you attended?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. You just didn&#8217;t physically attend?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro Stevens: I didn&#8217;t physically attend cuz that was the year that we had to virtually attend. So, um, yeah, uh, it</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: was north. Oh, so it&#8217;s a seance you attended, I mean, you, you were there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro Stevens: Yes. Yeah. Yes. Uh, attended, um, Northeast Ohio work camp in 2021. So, and what I mean by attendance, I&#8217;m talking about like, I didn&#8217;t just go there to go or attend, I was speaking, so that was the big part of my attendance versus just going to a world camp as an attendee, if that makes sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: So that&#8217;s the one who stood out. What was your talk on?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro Stevens: Uh, my talk for 2021 was, um, five. Look at my notes here. It was, uh, about modern marketing for, uh, minority and underrepresented businesses using WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: And was that the first one you physically attended? The one you spoke on? Virtually? Virtually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sorry. Virtually, yes. I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;m getting my, see, that&#8217;s why my blood sugar&#8217;s low. I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m fasting right now and my doctor said as it wasn&#8217;t a good idea to come on a podcast while that was going on, so forgive me, but how did you speak at any virtually, have you spoken virtually before at anything before that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro Stevens: Never. Never a WordPress specific, uh, topic based scenario, but other things I had, yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Okay, so you did, so it wasn&#8217;t your first real, it wasn&#8217;t your first rodeo. Just a just a little bit different speaking in front of a different audience though.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro Stevens: So prior to then, so I&#8217;m 36 years old. I feel like I gotta put this out here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel like I don&#8217;t judge, I&#8217;m real young here. Like you, you try to call me out with the Stanley Cooper thing. So I&#8217;m saying I&#8217;m 36. My, uh, I, you&#8217;re</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: younger than me, sir. So you take, well, I&#8217;m, you take the ball and</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro Stevens: run with it. I&#8217;m saying this to say, um, I, I started the WordPress late, so I didn&#8217;t even know WordCamps existed prior to 2018, which all of you were well endowed into the WordCamp WordPress system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So thank you. It was totally new for me at that time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Well, are you looking, are you planning on tending another one?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro Stevens: Do you want me to drop a secret?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Oh, yes, yes. I need the ratings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro Stevens: So, um, hope, I don&#8217;t know when this is gonna air, but, um, I actually am hosting a workshop at Work Camp Europe. Athens. Greece.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Well, there you go. Wow. That is a Well, that escalated quickly. That&#8217;s what, that&#8217;s amazing. Well, congratulations. Don&#8217;t, don&#8217;t say anymore cuz we don&#8217;t want to get you in trouble. So you are going to be, have you ever spoken out of the country before? No. Oh, so it&#8217;s gonna be, wow. I&#8217;m gonna watch the, uh, cam, I&#8217;ll, I&#8217;ll have to find someone to point a camera at you cuz get, get, get you in your most nervous moment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Tune into an animated gift because my therapist says that&#8217;s what works best for me and my condition. So, very good. Very well done, sir. Okay. Well, northwest Ohio, they need some representation. So, Northeast, excuse me. Northeast. No, we don&#8217;t wanna, no,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro Stevens: they&#8217;re, we&#8217;re serious about that now. N eo</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: now we serious about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don&#8217;t wanna represent the northwest. Those sons of motherless goats, those people. This, that&#8217;s a, I can&#8217;t swear on this. All right. Northeast Ohio 2021. It is. And welcome to the, welcome to the 2020s. So, Uh, work camps on our list. So last ends with me. I&#8217;m gonna go with, uh, I I I didn&#8217;t wanna pick, uh, any work camp Miamis.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I think that would&#8217;ve been way too easy if, if, uh, cuz I, I, I&#8217;ve been involved in the organization of that for a decade. I will say though, that work Camp Miami, I think Pat we already mentioned 2018. I, if I had to pick one of that, if I had to pick a second place, that would&#8217;ve been it. We had a thousand people at the FIU campus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was also the same year. The bridge collapsed. There was a bridge collapse at, at the, um, at the campus. Uh, there was some in like a day before the conference, a bridge spanning over a highway collapse that connected the school with the parking lot. And it was major pana. It was, they had to close the school.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, fortunately we were able to keep open. It was just pure madness. Uh, we had to coordinate with the. With the WordCamp committee to, to, to make sure things were okay. And communication got out and people were, it was, it was just a, for the first day it was really a big mess. And it was very sa It was a sad occasion too on top of it, cuz some people did, did lose their lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But on the, on the, uh, what helped, what helped deal with that is that we had over a, still over 1,011 hundred people attend that conference, which was the largest work camp Miami in one of the largest non regional work camps up to that time. We think that&#8217;s the one with the, where we did have our 80 eighties theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had people dressed like, uh, various eighties stars giving, giving talks. So we asked, we kind of had a costume contest at the same time, um, and the swag. But since I can&#8217;t pick a work camp Miami, I&#8217;m gonna go ahead and pick work Camp West 2016. Just, I just, this is, um, I&#8217;m kind of cheating a little bit by going with the, um, Go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, let&#8217;s see. Going with the, sorry, I&#8217;m just doing, I&#8217;m gonna have to edit this out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was the very first one, right? Actually, I got my picks mixed up. I got my, oh, I got my picks mixed up. So anyway, um, don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll edit that part out. But we&#8217;re the, actually the work Camp Miami 20th 10th anniversary was my pick. I will find a way to edit this to make it sound coherent, but yes. Work Camp Miami 10th anniversary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got to pick my own work Camp Miami as my most memorable moment. And just to repeat myself, because I&#8217;m gonna edit out the part, I&#8217;m gonna delete the last part. Um, I got my work camps mixed in. So like I said, there was an 80 theme. We had over a thousand people come. There was that. That was that unfortunate incident.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The bridge collapsed. Um, so we got off to our rough start, but everybody, we, we couldn&#8217;t, we didn&#8217;t have our pre-party because of that incident, um, at the work Camp Miami. But Friday our workshops went off with a good start. Um, we had three workshops, I think like a couple hundred people came to those. Um, we had Matt show up for Work Camp Miami for the 10th anniversary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, he was in the neighborhood. He decided to drop by and we had at the very end, one of the most attended closing remarks, um, ever. We have a really great picture of it. I&#8217;ll, I&#8217;ll try to remember to put it in show notes. It&#8217;s a really good PR picture for any work camp, but especially for us. We also had like a two day kids club and anytime someone says, um, like, like what&#8217;s a good example for a kids club?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for me personally, it was that two day kids club that we had at Work Camp Miami. And it, it really, like a lot of good things happened at that work camp from an organizer that I&#8217;m very proud of. But I will always look fondly at that 10th anniversary. The kids, the kids&#8217; club or the kids&#8217;, um, workshops were the highlight because they, we had, we actually split it up between young, young kids between, I don&#8217;t know, between five and 10 or five and 12 or six and 12.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we had one for the teenagers, the high schoolers, and the first day on a Saturday, they actually learned how to use WordPress. But on the second day we taught &#8216;EM marketing. So not only do they learning how to build WordPress websites, e-commerce websites, specifically on day one, but on day two they were taught how to market those websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, And that to me is a model for the getting the younger people more interested in the word in WordPress going forward. It&#8217;s not just, this is how you blog or this is how you move a block. Yes. But you really, these days especially need to teach the young people how it really applies to them when they, when young people, I&#8217;m gonna throw out some young kids&#8217;, kids&#8217; terms here when they&#8217;re on the tos, when they&#8217;re on the tu toots, whatever, over in the Instagrams, like for, they&#8217;re not very hard concepts or networks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right? But, but even more so is like, how can I use this platform either to entertain myself or how to make money or how to get myself popular? Which hopefully when you get old enough, eventually it turns into how can I make a living off of this? Or how can I use this to my advantage? And the technology comes second to those priorities, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, Our kids camp. That was the whole point of teaching kids, okay, this is how you build something. But tomorrow we&#8217;re gonna show you how you can market this and sell. If you wanna make any e-commerce story, this is how you market it. This is how you get into the search engines, or this is how you use these plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is how you create a business plan, which was actually part of the course. So anyway, work Camp Miami 10th anniversary, the eighties theme just ruled. Um, I wish I had a poster, um, but I&#8217;ll share the link in the show notes to a lot of the posters we took, like we had a back to the future theme for our sponsor posters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was just a really great time. So anyway, I digress. Hopefully I&#8217;ve covered over some of my mistakes and now you know what my next gonna be, but we Camp Miami 10th anniversary 2018 was my, was my pick on that. Alright, so now we&#8217;re in round three. Thank and this is why we didn&#8217;t do it live people. Round three last category, Aruba.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are going to cover now the state of the word announcements. So you didn&#8217;t have to be there in person. Just to clarify, you didn&#8217;t have to be there in person. You didn&#8217;t even have to be into WordPress at the time, technically speaking. But if there&#8217;s anything historic, anything that stands out to you. Um, the favorite, Matt Moway, so this is Matt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt was giving these in person up until Covid. So I believe his last in-person WordCamp, uh, state of the word was 2019. And I don&#8217;t think he&#8217;s done in-person state of the word since. Sarah could probably back me up on this probably, but I think he&#8217;s done virtual ones ever since, starting in 2020. And uh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarah Gooding: I think he did, didn&#8217;t he do one in New York City or one or two?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He did in New York City with a small audience. It wasn&#8217;t like at a WordCamp, but it was like, yeah, yeah, you&#8217;re right. You&#8217;re technically, but, um, yeah, it wasn&#8217;t attached to a WordCamp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: You&#8217;re right. I, I misspoke. So not attached to WordCamp. Not a WordCamp. Yes. Used to be a U WordCamp Us. Um, Tradition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exclusive. Yeah, yeah. Tradition at the end, everybody would line up, get into the room, get into this big room, and people would approach the mics. Um, some infamous people would&#8217;ve questions every year. Um, and if you, sometimes you, sometimes you couldn&#8217;t answer, sometimes you couldn&#8217;t get to all the questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, and then in 2020, I know he did a couple of virtual ones every year, and then I&#8217;m gonna guess 2021, he probably started, um, having them in the Tumblr office. I could be wrong on that. Mm-hmm. But it was a small audience. But ever since then, they, they were disconnected from WordCamps in 2019. Now your favorite, um, this is the announcement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can pick, you can you all pick and pick the same state of the word, but you can&#8217;t pick the same announcement during the state of the word. So that&#8217;s, so that&#8217;s that, those are the rules. So Aruba, in case any of that made sense, What would you like to tell us would be your best, your, your, your favorite, most memorable state of the word announcement or a state of the anything mentioned at State of the Word, I should say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aurooba Ahmed: So the very first WordCamp I went to, that wasn&#8217;t WordCamp Calgary was WordCamp US 2019. And that was very memorable for me. So it was the very first time I also saw a state of the word in person and the thing that really I still remember to this day. And it really drove home for me. What we are now doing with WordPress was when Matt told us that the slides were all made inside Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wow. That every single one was using and they had just sort of finished live coding it. You know, Ella, one of the core contributors, she had built this plugin and it lets you basically use reveal js and have this block. And so each slide was just a block in this single document where Gutenberg page and it was full screen and it had like really lovely design, even had a little bit of animation and it was like, wow, you know, this, this is, it was such a clear demonstration of what we were capable of, what we were trying to aim for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the block editor and I just, it was, it was, it was a core or a press memory for me for sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: I&#8217;ll try if, if you, when you send your links, if you, um, you people have done so much work enough, I really appreciate it. If you can, if you can find the video and find that timestamp to that mm-hmm. When you made that announcement, that would be great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I almost wanted it that point to have WordPress be a slide maker. I&#8217;m surprised no one has really come out with the plugin for that since, or maybe they have, but that must be There is a plugin. Oh. To make slides out of</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aurooba Ahmed: the original plugin is in the repo and since then there have been multiple other plug-in plugins that, you know, let you create slides with WordPress that are out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Well that&#8217;s, I&#8217;ve done it for a presentation myself. It&#8217;s really cool. Lots of fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Okay, so that was work Camp US 2019, right? Yeah, that&#8217;s right. The last in person one I, I remember. Mm-hmm. I remember. Mm-hmm. Being in the audience. I can&#8217;t remember that specifically cuz I was probably tweeting too fast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. Well great. That&#8217;s fantastic. So we still, we have the Gutenberg. Hey, turns out these are slides announcement from Work Camp US 2019. So Sarah, so you I&#8217;m sure covered a lot of state of the words at the tavern over the years. What was the one that stood out to you? Or what announcement or something brought in the state, in a state of a word, stood out to you the most?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarah Gooding: Yeah, I usually do a writeup every, every year for the state of the word. And, uh, 2014, um, in, at Ward Camp San Francisco. It was the last ward camp San Francisco. And Matt announced this is the last time we&#8217;re gonna be here and, uh, we&#8217;re next year we&#8217;re gonna continue with Ward Camp us. So that was like a, a major change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, And it was kind of like WordPress was stepping into its global destiny, I felt like, because, um, he also at that time announced that it was a big turning point for the project because, um, the number of non-English downloads surpassed the number of English downloads of WordPress. Yeah. So the software was just getting more of a global user base.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, he announced that basically they&#8217;d outgrown their flagship WordCamp and we&#8217;re moving it to a whole, a bigger one. And, um, we out, we outgrew I R C and we moved to Slack that year. So that was kind of a big thing. It was a major change for the project&#8217;s, communication tools. Um, and at that time, I think Fiber, the future had just started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So he, he said during that address, this is what&#8217;s gonna take us from 23% to 30% or 40%, 23%. And it was so ambitious at the time. It was, I mean, who, who could imagine at that time that, that WordPress would be 40% of the web? And um, it was just an exciting time to be a part. I was, I was there at the WordCamp, um, but there was so much energy because WordPress was growing so fast and it was every year you&#8217;re gonna expect it&#8217;s gonna grow and grow and outpace all its competitors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And uh, it was a great, it was just a great time to start getting involved because um, the energy was, was so good at that time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Yeah, I remember the excitement about award camp us cuz it definitely, there wasn&#8217;t anything beyond a city level at that time. Maybe, maybe, maybe a few regionals, maybe, you know, along those lines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it was nothing on a continent. Well it&#8217;s not a continent, David, you gotta go back to school on a country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarah Gooding: I think they might have, they might have done WordCamp Europe by then, I&#8217;m</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: not sure. Was Work Camp Europe first. I think it, yes, I think it was so,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarah Gooding: and there was kind of a rivalry for a while.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seemed like, you know, WordCamp Europe is bigger, or WordCamp US is bigger. And then remember just back and forth every year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Remember I remember WordCamp, I remember Matt saying that he wanted WordCamp us to be bigger than that. I, I didn&#8217;t think that, I didn&#8217;t think that was gonna be possible cuz just on geography alone, um, just because Europe is just so much bigger in terms of, in terms of that than a, than a US would, would, would be able to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But yeah, so we did have Work Camp Europe, but, but really regardless of size work, camp US is a, is the flagship event of all the work camps, at least in my mind. And it&#8217;s not just because of size, it&#8217;s just because it was, I, I think because of that. Day in 2014 where it&#8217;s like, and I guess maybe, maybe it is a, maybe it is a United States centric thing for me, cuz I live in the US but it was kind of along the lines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve seemed like that was Matt&#8217;s home WordCamp. And as WordCamp US kind of progressed, taken two cities every year. Was it? It was, yeah, it was the same city two years in a row. Move on to a different city. Matt just seemed to embrace the, remember the boot on stage in Memphis. Um, he just seemed to embrace the, I mean, where Campy West was Matt, and it&#8217;s not, it was, it was not it, you know, the two seemed pretty closely linked together and although he did attend work Camp Europe, um, I don&#8217;t remember him giving a state of the word at work Camp Europe either moving forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He always did it in San Francisco and then kind of did it at us, um, for a while. So that to me was always like the home work camp because Matt was always. They&#8217;re doing his state of the word. That was, that was the, that was the central thing. And of cor of course, Europe was, was bigger, but it was, it was the WordCampy west that always seemed to be a special home for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I, I guess that, does anybody ever, did anybody ever attend the last one in San Francisco in 2014? I, I was there. Yeah, I was, I was there too. I think that was the one where they had the fire alarm or the medical emergency or something too. Mm-hmm. And, uh, yeah, it was very tightly packed in there. Um, the state, when Matt did his state of the word, people were sitting, like, I, I was, I had, I had to get like there an hour before just to be in the front row and super glue myself to the seat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which was embarrassing because I didn&#8217;t bring a change of pants. So anyway, that&#8217;s a different story. I so work camps San Francisco 2014 when we announced work camp us among all the other things that Sarah mentioned too. So that is a very memorable war camp and what I can appreciate cuz I was there. All right, Jess, keep this train going along here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What work camp, or excuse me, what state of the word announcement sticks out in your mind?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jess Frick: Also exciting, but in a different way. 2018</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: WordCamp US 2018. Yes. It</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jess Frick: was as if the entire stage was surrounded by gasoline and half the audience had pitchforks, like the tension was palpable in the room. And everybody&#8217;s like, oh my God, what is he gonna say when he gets on the stage?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And he starts with this video of people just talking about how crappy the interface was on the old WordPress. And we&#8217;re like, yeah, actually he&#8217;s, he&#8217;s not wrong. And then they show. Guttenberg. That was when Morton got up and brought up some really reasonable questions about transparency, and I think that was the first time a lot of people really started thinking about, you know, how much transparency is there for contributors?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, you know, what do you have a say in? And honestly, like, I don&#8217;t wanna turn this into like a Matt Fangirl moment, but honestly that was one of the times where I most admired Matt&#8217;s leadership of the project because I felt like he really stood in front of the team and took the bullets and then said, Hey, I hear you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel you. Feel free to get involved and make, you know, informed opinions in our dev meetings and we&#8217;d love to have you, but otherwise maybe just hang out. Um, I, I feel, and that&#8217;s of course me cribbing it, but I thought that he handled it with. Grace and elegance. And I thought that at the end of it, people were a lot more, I feel like the vibe was a lot more relaxed and excited about the go forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, most of the WordCamp had, you know, built up this tension and it definitely felt a release after that. Um, yeah, I, I had been to other state of the words, but none really shined quite like that for me. Um, now Matt&#8217;s, Matt&#8217;s a great leader and I&#8217;m not just saying that because he&#8217;s, you know, essentially my boss, um, but also because he is my boss.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but it really was a really great moment, I think, for the WordPress project. And that was when I really wanted to get involved into contributing. Um, cause you know, if you&#8217;re gonna cry for transparency, you should probably do something with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: It took a lot of guts to probably get up there because like you said, this was the same event.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where a couple of days before people were in their hotel rooms coordinating with teams to get their stuff ready for Gutenberg. Right. Um, controversy going forward and like, wait, I, the amount of discussion, because remember, you know, this was before where camp started, so once I think, I think when I think we got out of that mode of rush, rush, rush, rush, like updates happening every, you know, probably on Twitter we were just monitoring the, the entire.org forms was, was just nuts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, slack was nuts. Um, I think it was, it was Slack then I think, right? Yeah. It was whatever form we were communicating with, it was, it was, it was nuts. And then work camp started and then you had that. Like he&#8217;s taught, like that wasn&#8217;t the fir, that was the last thing at work camp us. Right? So you had hallway was, I remember having hallway conversations about the, and I won&#8217;t, I won&#8217;t go into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, it was, it was more just nervousness than negativity, but it was just like, you know, people were on edge. And for Matt to have that state of the word and like in that kind of, um, I, it, it took a lot, it took a lot of guts to, for anybody to do that and, um, for anybody to ask questions. And that did lead to conversations with Morton and then from thereafter about transparency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Does any, does anybody remember, um, that particular feeling in the community at that time?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>See, seeing some nods there? Yeah, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s okay. I wouldn&#8217;t have answered that question either vocally and been on the record. That&#8217;s fine. Uh, there&#8217;s too much, uh, uh, I, I think people forget. Like how hectic it was then. And I think because of the way Matt handled that, even with probably looking back on it, I think some things maybe could have been handled better in hindsight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, but you know what, what, when you look back on something, what&#8217;s, how does that differ from anything, anything else in terms of how you can handle anything better? I did make a notable, he did make a notable comment about more transparency. Yeah. Um, because honestly, up to that point in time, the reason why things weren&#8217;t so hectic is because it&#8217;s not as transparent as things are today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s how I looked at it. If everybody feel free to, you know, jump into here, I&#8217;m, but now that with especially Josepha, um, over the years being more transparent, the things on.org, I think a lot of that transparency would&#8217;ve taken us over time, a lot slower to evolve if it wasn&#8217;t for. How Matt handled that and the people asking him questions deserve as much credit as that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that was a very difficult time too, because the media, there was a lot of media attention on that state of the word outside of WordPress too. And I&#8217;m not sure if people remember that, but, um, I remember like news organizations and I, I don&#8217;t remember the, the ones that existed then probably don&#8217;t exist now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I don&#8217;t know what, but a lot of news organizations, this was in the news, is that the one where the mayor came on stage? I can&#8217;t remember. But this was on, this was in the news. This was, um, this was big news to the, to the entire internet that WordPress, whatever market share hold the time has launched This Gutenberg editor and Matt Longway was in the news was, was on lot of tech websites that were not WordPress related.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a big deal. So that probably was the most media attention, media focused. Hectic nervous ball of nerves type of state of the word that probably I can ever, ever think of. So that was definitely one for the history book. So where camp u s 2018 in Gutenberg.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarah Gooding: I think all that, that controversy was so healthy though, because you had all these really high profile contributors and business people who were like, no, this isn&#8217;t ready to ship yet and you&#8217;re giving us three days notice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it was, it was, it was a discussion. And, and Matt was very present there. He was in the dev meetings and he, he was back and forth and, and you gotta remember like all these people really grew up together in their careers. I mean, this is, some of these people have a 20 year history together. Yeah. You know, at least 10 or 15 years for a lot of the people who own the, these big businesses or have been contributing a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you know, some of &#8217;em are real brave to speak up and be like, Hey, this isn&#8217;t cool. We don&#8217;t want releases like this in the future. And, um, You know, the, it&#8217;s amazing to see how the project, the project has changed over the years, and especially Josepha has been just amazing. But, but they, all these people have grown up together and they&#8217;ve, they&#8217;ve matured together and the project has matured and it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s really a cool thing to watch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, uh, I think controversies like that are, are good because it means that people feel free to talk to each other still. It&#8217;s not just some, some cold corporation style thing that the, you know, it&#8217;s a family and people are gonna speak their minds and, and it&#8217;s healthy and it, and I like that. It was an exciting time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: I&#8217;d be honest. I mean, to me, I think some people stuck I, the further away we get from that moment, which is, it was 2018, so that&#8217;s like what, five years from, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s a distant memory now, but I know some people look back and instill with a bit of anxiety. Uh, so</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jess Frick: I don&#8217;t think 2020 and 2021 were real. So it really was just like two years ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Whenever some, i I, this will always be a word can, well, it&#8217;ll always be a time where somebody&#8217;s gonna say, well, you know what, back then this happened and it wasn&#8217;t great and blah, blah, blah. But it, it kind of like, it was definitely a, like a growing up point in terms for the whole community. It&#8217;s time to put our big person pants on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And yeah, some Matt admitted some things were not, were his decision, but they weren&#8217;t, they weren&#8217;t right. But they were his decision. They took responsibility from &#8217;em. And we have some of the things today. We have the trans, we have the transparency today and things today because of the conversations that came from that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aurooba Ahmed: we also have more contributors now because of it. I mean, I&#8217;m one of those people who was affected before that. I had never contributed to WordPress before 2018. You know, uh, the, the merging of Gutenberg decor was not just a moment of like a chapter change for the software or even for the folks who were growing up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was also a moment of it created space for new blood, which I don&#8217;t think really existed before. And I still think that, you know, we&#8217;re also doing work to make contr, uh, contributor stuff easier for everyone. But that was for me, a really big, like milestone. Like looking at it from, as in just coming into that community at that time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, oh, okay, I, I could actually do something here too. You know? I don&#8217;t have to just wait for all these other people who&#8217;ve been here for the last, like, many years, these, uh, the legacy folks and, uh, and wait for them to do something. I could maybe do something too. So, and you&#8217;re walking. That&#8217;s something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s how I remember looking into it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Yeah. And you&#8217;re walking in brand new, like, why is everybody so nervous?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aurooba Ahmed: Well, it was still nerve-wracking, right? Like it was also one of those things that affected, it was an economic. Problem because it affected people&#8217;s livelihoods in a very deep and impactful way that other updates didn&#8217;t necessarily do, or other updates before They did create that impact, but it was almost always a little bit positive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this one was like, it could be positive, it could be negative. It&#8217;s like a, like we took something that was like this and we said, oh, okay. It&#8217;s like this now. Like, what, what&#8217;s going on? Took a leap. So it&#8217;s different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Yeah. And there was also the four phases of Gutenberg and very, mm-hmm. And then which, which, which kind of laid out the entire plan, which we are still going, we&#8217;re entering phase three as we speak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So anyway, Maestro, we want to get to you, um, state of the word announcement or anything you want to tackle there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro Stevens: I&#8217;ll segue the, um, the phases of Gutenberg. I think that for myself and then with Aruba, what you were saying as far as the, uh, contributing to like bridge them together. I think it, I don&#8217;t know if it was 2020 or 2021, so anybody can help me out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I got really excited when Matt started talking about the collaboration. Um, that was something that, it was just super cool bringing Google Docs type features, you know, um, to WordPress. And for me, um, as a new contributor, that was, uh, in essence, um, I would say a part of, um, how I feel like other people can contribute that aren&#8217;t really WordPress savvy by being able to at least collaborate with other word pressers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, that was awesome. I believe it was 2020 when he was, if I&#8217;m not mistaken, the, uh, instead of the word, um, when he had mentioned it. Cause I started watching them after they were, uh, they weren&#8217;t, you know, attributed to the WordCamps themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Yeah. Collaboration&#8217;s big. Uh, we&#8217;ll find the, we&#8217;ll we&#8217;ll see if we can find the time set.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I honestly can&#8217;t remember. Like the four phases were always laid out and collaboration was always phase three, but I can, but there was very little detail in the very beginning, like 2018, what those phases were actually gonna be. So 2020 sounds about right cuz I, um, I remember sitting virtually getting more information about the collaboration stuff and over, over the years it&#8217;s gotten a little bit more detailed, but what about, well, Maestro, since uh, I, since you&#8217;ve been, you&#8217;ve been humbly listening to all of us Jabber about our old days.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What specifically about the collaboration stuff stood out to you the most? Why, why would you be excited about that particular phase? Why did that stick out in your mind?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro Stevens: Well, I felt for a while it was kind of annoying, um, having to</p>\n\n\n\n<p>get permission or kick somebody out. Of being able to edit the page. Ah, and that would like that, that hurt a lot of production time. Um, it made people have to communicate a lot more. It made you have to wait, um, if you are patient or not patient. It made you have to practice patience. Like you got kids. Um,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: I kicked them out of their blogs all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro Stevens: Yeah, right. You know, so it was, it was, uh, for, for, for me and for some people that I knew, it was definitely a great, uh, aspect of them being able to work alongside. And so that was different for, um, me working with a designer and a developer. The fact that they can both, like if they can both be in, when he announced that if they can both be on the same page at the same time along with myself and we&#8217;re all kind of doing our own thing, we just have to wait for each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That to me was just invaluable. Cause I&#8217;ve been using Google Docs forever and I think a lot of people have, um, have, have gotten used to being able to like edit things in real time. And it was the real time factor that I thought was so cool. I had no idea. Word Press. Was going to do or could do?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Do you think that could be the next wow factor in terms of Gutenberg?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean the, I mean, we, full side editing is big, but to the outside world, I don&#8217;t think it has been as revolutionary because well, side editing exists, right, exists outside of WordPress. But I, correct me if I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m this, hopefully we get this out in a video form, but I, in case you&#8217;re listening to the audio, everybody&#8217;s nodding their head yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just want to let that, I just wanna make that clear. Uh, but I&#8217;m imagining the collaboration more than just editing a Google Doc type of a thing. I, I&#8217;m hoping, I&#8217;m hoping that collaboration also means I&#8217;m seeing someone drag a block here while I&#8217;m dragging a block over there on the page. Big, my like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s the level. Like we think of collaboration as Google Docs, which is fine cuz we&#8217;ve grown up with that. Google has nailed that functionality and over the years other people have caught up. Even, you know, apple and other people took a while for them to polish that out. That wasn&#8217;t their strength.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But now, but now it&#8217;s, you know, like that&#8217;s table stakes now in terms of if, if you&#8217;re collaborating, if there&#8217;s any collaboration at all. Like unless you&#8217;re a journal app that is just you or the author, there has to be some sort of sharing or collabora, you know, live, you&#8217;re seeing someone else&#8217;s cursor on your screen, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was built into Apple&#8217;s os later on. But Google pretty much set the, set, the standard moving forward. But you know, so that is a standard. So if that is done in WordPress, editing a document, editing text, uh, I&#8217;m hoping there&#8217;s more and I hope WordPress gets that, that wow feature factor. Kind of back, which is difficult to do when you do open source, cuz it&#8217;s not like you&#8217;ve kept, you can&#8217;t keep something hidden.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. And then release it, because that&#8217;s not, you&#8217;re not gonna get open source con contributors doing that. It&#8217;s all gonna be out in the open. So it&#8217;s not gonna be a surprise to us. But I&#8217;m hoping that you can start dragging blocks and building pages, like seeing things being built in front of you and just like, um, I think it was, was it was, was it, I forgot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m sorry. What? Who was who? Who was com Uh, I think Jess said, I think it was you about like when go, that video started that guttenberg about all these people complaining by the editor and then you saw the new editor. I want to see a video like that when, when the, when the collaboration tools come and you just see live on a video or even live like this is, this is this whole, how about the slides were, somebody should just like, you know that that meme with the dog and the, and the, and the railroad tracks from a walls and grot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Yeah. Um, you know how he&#8217;s putting down the railroad tracks really fast. There&#8217;s a tr as he&#8217;s building it as the train goes. I would like to see that in slide form, in WordCamp, state of the word maybe,  or something along those lines. Some live demo or live presentation or really slick video of really cool collaboration tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aurooba Ahmed: I think if you put collaboration and multilingual together in one video, it&#8217;s like p</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: yeah. It&#8217;s, I can understand multilingual and I understand people&#8217;s, like, why don&#8217;t you put multilingual before that? Because we really need it. We really need it. I can understand why it&#8217;s the last one because I think that&#8217;s the most complex part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that could be the most complex of all, everything. And you, you wanna map your things out probably before you start breaking things up in terms of translations. But yeah, just imagine esp uh, I don&#8217;t want to get too ahead of ourselves, but like, I, I, I&#8217;ll, I did like a what would be a, um, ooh, there, there&#8217;s a good question.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We could, we could probably end on real quick. Um, a spot on question, um, for me, Just real quick, um, my state of the word, um, was basically, uh, 2016 state of the word Matt. Matt, um, was featuring, uh, the year before 2015 was, and I can&#8217;t believe anybody picked this, but I&#8217;m not picking it, but he did say learn JavaScript deeply, I believe in 2015 and then tw in 2016.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He, and that&#8217;s probably his most quoted phrase of any state of the word, was learn JavaScript deeply in 2015. That&#8217;s why no one picked it. Yes, all of you, all of you should be proud of yourselves, but that&#8217;s not the one I&#8217;m picking in 2016, what happened was after I heard that in 2015 where Camp Miami was like four months away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I came back as one of the organizers and I got with the team and we made a learn JavaScript deeply track at Work Camp Miami based upon what he said because back then there was not a lot of focus on JavaScript and we needed to get up to speak to it real quick. And that&#8217;s what we did through that track.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then the following work, uh, after that at Miami in 2016, Unknown to me. He, he put like in one of his slides, like a, um, let&#8217;s see, hold on a second here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m gonna put it in our chat so you can take a look. He took a screenshot of the, yeah, thanks. You can s if you&#8217;re gonna laugh, okay. Mute yourself. Thank you. Everybody right now is, God, I hate you all. That&#8217;s a lot of hair gel. David. The sad part is it&#8217;s not hair gel. The, the point is, is that he took a schedule of where Camp Miami and he put it up there, which was fine cuz he wanted to feature p you know, us getting into JavaScript and listening to his advice every year earlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that he found the worst possible picture of me and put it next to it. Now that&#8217;s bad for two reasons. One, because that&#8217;s not, I don&#8217;t think a representative of War Camp Miami cuz it wasn&#8217;t just me. Um. Other organizers were involved, but two, that was just a bad picture. And I remember you look so happy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I was young and I, I don&#8217;t know if I had kids back then, but the point is, the point is, is that I was in the audience and I saw it and I was live tweeting at the time and like, you know, I almost had to change my pants. It was, it was just the moment. And I c it was just the, probably the most embarrassing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I had people looking at me going like, man, you, you look just as just like that guy. And I&#8217;m going, yeah, that&#8217;s me. And uh, but so I got to be on a slide, just, you know, next time, you know, I wish my PR people would, would&#8217;ve coordinated with his PR people. So anyway, I&#8217;ll include a link to that picture in the show notes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that was probably like the work camp 2016 I got on a slide and I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s gonna happen twice. So that&#8217;ll be etched in history. I&#8217;ll never get a better picture. Yeah, I look better. You know, we could use another slide. But anyway, that&#8217;s, that was my story. All right. So we went from us. We, so we, we went from 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All of these were work camp uss, of course, except for San Francisco in 2014. So I think that&#8217;s not a surprise there. Um, actually 2020 was virtual, so not, not work camp us. So anyway, that was, that was fun. Now as we wrap things up here, is there, I&#8217;m gonna go in order one last time or one last time. If there&#8217;s anything real quick you wanna bring up, just like we can&#8217;t be as detailed as we were before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s gonna be rapid fires. Is there anything that we didn&#8217;t bring up one or two quick memories that didn&#8217;t fit into these categories? Aruba, we&#8217;ll start with you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aurooba Ahmed: Hmm. I can&#8217;t think of anything. I am very happy to not have gotten sniped and got all my memories in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Okay, that&#8217;s fine. If, if you&#8217;ve got, if, if you&#8217;re happy, I&#8217;m happy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarah, is there anything that, that&#8217;s, that, uh, you. That didn&#8217;t fit into those categories you&#8217;ve covered over the years that,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarah Gooding: uh, I have more that do fit into the categories, but, um, nothing outside categories. Uh, I had a couple other links that I thought were interesting, um, that were, that actually happened at WordCamp Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, in 2017 in, in Paris. Matt announced that the Gutenberg plugin was ready for testing. And I thought it was kind of, kind of cool because he hadn&#8217;t been doing big announcements at WordCamp Europe. I mean, he was, he would usually save all the big announcements for WordCamp us. So that was like a major thing that the European WordPress community got to be first in on, or, you know, they got to hear the news first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then in, um, the next year, like one year later, I think it was June, 2018 when he unveiled the roadmap for how Gutenberg was getting into core. And it was just like months away, which started like every, all the people, um, were just scrambling to get ready at that point because he was like, okay, here it comes, we&#8217;re gonna go for it in 5.0.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And um, and that was an exciting time. I remember I contacted probably like 10 or 15 different people who had freelance businesses or agencies, and I said, what, what are y&#8217;all doing to get ready? And then I, I wrote this post about morphine. You know, some of, some people were like, I&#8217;m just gonna wait and see and I&#8217;ll see if anyone likes this block editor or not, and then maybe I&#8217;ll update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Some people are still doing that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarah Gooding: And then, you know, and then there are others who were like, oh, we&#8217;ve already dedicated an entire team to get us ready for Gutenberg. And we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re already, you know, they&#8217;re giving a very good, uh, just very good PR as far as their readiness for it. And, uh, that was a fun time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I thought that was cool that he saved, he had given both of those big announcements at WordCamp Europe years later. Once that was just, it was established as just, I think it was the biggest WordCamp for a long time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Yeah. Agreed. Agreed. So, Jess, Jess, anything we missed?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jess Frick: This might, this is probably gonna sound way cheesy when I say it than it is in</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: my head.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re on a panel with me. You&#8217;re safe because I&#8217;ll Okay, cool. Standing next to me, you are the opposite of cheese. What?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jess Frick: So, you know, uh, Mr. Rogers, you know, he&#8217;s quoted as saying, you know, when he was afraid his mom would tell him to look for the helpers. And when I think about the history of WordPress, I think about the people in the community and the countless, you know, GoFundMe and somebody gets sick and they can&#8217;t work, or their kid gets hurt, or, you know, during C O V I D when so many different things were upside down.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, you know, we&#8217;ve talked a lot about the really cool, about the really technology, but what&#8217;s been amazing to me is to see people that have come together over the years and all the cool things that they&#8217;re doing, um, to support one another. Um, even as recently as like last week, everybody was pitching in to help somebody who somehow found themselves homeless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s been really, really cool to see so many good people join together under the umbrella and all the good that we do for open source and personal. I told you it was gonna sound kind of cheesy. Uh, but I mean it,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Well, I, there&#8217;s so many different aspects of the WordPress community that could fit into, um, Kim Parsons is, do I have that name right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. Okay. Sh not the first ex, not the first example of, of a member of the community passing away, but I bel But it was, it was, she was well known by a lot of people and which started the, um, the WordCamp Scholarship. Scholarship. Right. I&#8217;m sorry. Thanks. Mm-hmm. Thanks. So, but she is just one example of so many, like we have scholarships for, for, for diversities now, now for other people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was, um, the, I can think of a half a dozen people that have passed away over the years too, that have gotten there every year. We remember them. Um, and that&#8217;s very kind of, Very unique for a community for to do something like that even on, um, regardless of the scale. So yeah, the community really kind of pitches together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we also kinda have fun too. We, we, we do podcasts like this, um, you know, you know, of our own free will except for that one person and blackmailing to be on this panel today. But other than that, we&#8217;re doing this because we are a tight-knit community. So, yeah, I think that&#8217;s great. I think that&#8217;s a great thing to keep in mind over the past 20 years, you know, and there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s drama, but I mean, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s, we&#8217;re we&#8217;re still a collective group for the most part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so finally, uh, my</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jess Frick: Sarah mentioned earlier. People are growing up together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Yeah. Bringing ki bringing their own kids to work camps. Right. Somebody, some, somebody supposedly conceived one at work camp I am at don&#8217;t that, so that&#8217;s not at the event. I meant during the weekend. Okay, we&#8217;re gonna have to edit that one out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, moving on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aurooba Ahmed: Wait, wait. I take it back. There is one like length thing that I wanted to talk about</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Uhoh, and that was when her eyes lit up. When soon as I started talking about conceiving children at work camps, her eyes lit up. You&#8217;re gonna have to go. Go ahead. Go ahead. You&#8217;ll ahead Back over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aurooba Ahmed: Yeah. Um, that was when Woo Commerce joined WordPress. That was a moment. Oh, it was a big moment, right? Because Woo. Commerce like woo themes, they were doing so well and they had become fast, become the fast, like the most popular e-commerce system in. Like e everywhere on the web and then automatic, uh, it was like the one, like a really big notable acquisition from Automatic before that there, I don&#8217;t know, I have no idea actually if they had done any other acquisitions before then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that one was like, it started the train of acquisitions a little bit and it was like, oh, we were Democrat democratizing publishing and now we&#8217;re democratizing e-commerce. And now it&#8217;s like democratizing like all kinds of other things, social media, et cetera. Right. But WooCommerce really, really began that sort of, um, moment in time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. For automatic and like how it affected all of us in the WordPress community,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: uh, au Speaking of acquisitions, I, you can&#8217;t go with 20 years of WordPress without talking about the acquisitions that&#8217;ve made in the last decade. Right. We saw the first decade of all these people that were starting companies like, um, like, um, Saed, Saed Automotive, but also Pippin and mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, like all these people who I&#8217;m drawing punks on right now, the first 10 years you would see them at the work camps and then most of them have moved on or sold their businesses or become acquired. And who&#8217;s, you know, the last, especially the last five or six years, so many WordPress companies that we saw give birth in the early part of the WordPress days now are more mature or they&#8217;ve been absorbed into larger companies and people that were working out of their basements are now like managing like dozens of people at height level companies, um, and, and the hosting companies too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right? Remember when hosting was so immature in the 20, uh, in the early days? Oh, yeah. And, uh, acquisitions. I, when you, when you said that I remember, um, I think it&#8217;s more recent, but in August of 2019, Tumblr Joint Automatic, which was huge. And yes, I think we still have to see the ultimate fruits of that labor because we&#8217;re starting to see Gutenberg and Tumblr now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aurooba Ahmed: And in day one, which was in the news pretty recently as well, the journaling app.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Yeah. So, and then I think that if anything is going to outlive, like what Matt said, if anything&#8217;s gonna outlive WordPress, it&#8217;s gonna be Gutenberg. Right. That&#8217;s, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s the ultimate. So it&#8217;s so exciting to see how automatic is automatic&#8217;s non WordPress business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not directly. We used to think of word of automatic as wordpress.com, but over the years with its acquisitions, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s now, it&#8217;s now so much more, but it&#8217;s affecting WordPress in ways that we never, I didn&#8217;t think we are, would realize, uh, 10 or 15 years ago. So, Micra, are you with us?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro Stevens: I am back. Sorry about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My computer is freezing, so I had to restart it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: No problem, sir.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro Stevens: It&#8217;s overheating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Oh yeah, you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re just too hot. All right. So, Hmm. Okay. I&#8217;m gonna have to, I wanna, wanna bet with my wife just now. Just thought I&#8217;d let you know. Um, said something like that. All right. So maestro, uh, bring it home for us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is there anything about, uh, that we may not have, uh, touched on tonight in terms of your, of, of terms, of things in the WordPress history, especially from your perspective?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro Stevens: I can&#8217;t think of anything. I think that we&#8217;ve touched on mostly everything I would say for me specifically, uh, back in 2020 when I was introduced to, um, o one of one of the plugins, themes and, and, uh, block plugins that I use in cadence, it was a very, um, revolutionary experience for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To say the least. I was using Elementor, I was using a page builder before then. People were talking a lot of crap about Gutenberg, a lot of controversy. I&#8217;m just keeping it real with you. Um, people were saying it was ready, it wasn&#8217;t ready. And then, um, you know, after testing a whole bunch of different, um, plug-ins and themes and they&#8217;re all, you know, a whole bunch of are, are so great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if I wanted to invest into an ecosystem, kind of like Apple, unfortunately, I thought my investment with Apple kind of suck right now. Cause I&#8217;m like, I got this expensive computer that just overheated, but I digressed. Um, uh, it was keep blowing. That changed everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Well, thanks. Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro Stevens: Yeah. That changed everything for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Well, that&#8217;s fantastic. Well, I mean, I think you&#8217;re, I I think we have a very good representation here and, and you especially because you&#8217;re coming in on the last couple of years and seeing it from that kind of different perspective with those kinds of eyes. Um, Is kind of, kind of now in 20 years, we&#8217;ll, we&#8217;ll be able to get from your point of view in like the mid midterm, you know, like the, the golden years, not the golden years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The, uh, kind of a golden age we&#8217;re entering into, uh, WordPress right now. So very, very excited to have you back along with everyone else in a few years and see, and see if your MacBook survives so we can talk to you a little bit more. So I wanted to, I What&#8217;s that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro Stevens: Just, um, just to touch on what you just said real quick, I think that, um, based on what everybody has talked about, cause you just made a good point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if I can give any context, like I&#8217;m not an old schooler here, so I&#8217;m really trying to help with different type of, um, generation and new type of people. I&#8217;m just keeping them 100% honest with you. That&#8217;s the way, reason why I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m, I coin myself and I&#8217;m called the fresh Prince of WordPress because I&#8217;m trying to give a fresh perspective.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, a lot people have no idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Does that make me the, um, Carlton I.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro Stevens: Uh, that was a good one. I see where you&#8217;re going with that one. I know Will Smith here. I don&#8217;t slap people. Alright. Um, but still, uh, the whole point was is that people don&#8217;t know that it has evolved a lot and there is a lot of people trying to enter into, uh, WordPress without that understanding that it&#8217;s not what it used to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I love having conversations with people like you all, cause I get both perspectives. I get people who have been there for 10, 20 years. Like if you have never heard of it trying to get it in and they&#8217;re like, I can&#8217;t do all that development stuff and all that code stuff and all that, and I have to teach them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, it&#8217;s not that it&#8217;s not the same, you have that opportunity, but it&#8217;s not that. So I think that this is fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Yeah. And I, I. Maister and I, this is the first time we&#8217;ve been face-to-face. I, he actually reached out to an invitation that I left on Black Press, which again is one of the many examples of how the community is trying to address, um, all the different aspects of that it, that it can in terms of diversity and outreach and finding new people, young, old, whatever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I really appreciate you reaching out to me through there. Um, It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s great to have all these different kinds of channels. Um, at least it it, because not everybody is on post status. Not everybody is on Twitter. Not everybody is here for various reasons. We can only, we can only be in so many channels at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. And it&#8217;s personal to us. So, you know, I&#8217;m in my channels because it mean, you know, it&#8217;s because of me. My, my livelihood, my background. I&#8217;m in these certain places. I can&#8217;t be everywhere. And everybody else is different. But we overlap in such ways that finding you in finding you in that area was, was, was a very, very, very thankful that you reached out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, cuz otherwise we wouldn&#8217;t have that kind of perspective and viewpoint from from, from that. So, anyway, I&#8217;m gonna go around and we&#8217;re just gonna close out. It was great having you all. And I want you, you can mention where people can find you on social or, you know, or, or, or whatever you wanna mention to bring up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ll, we&#8217;ll start with Rupa first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Aurooba Ahmed: All right. Well, I&#8217;m at Aruba pretty much everywhere, including a website, aruba.com. I&#8217;m also the co-host of a fun dev focused, uh, podcast called View Source, if you wanna check that out. View source.fm. And that&#8217;s me,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Sarah. Uh, it&#8217;s nice to meet you. I appreciate you Ruba coming on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I, I don&#8217;t mean to rush. I&#8217;m just, you get nervous when, when things close down and, um, you know that my kids are still locked in that closet and I, cuz and I really do need to feed them. So I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m not, I&#8217;m not pushing this along, uh, um, by, on purpose, but, you know, I&#8217;m getting a little nervous. Um, Sarah, I don&#8217;t know where, where people can find you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can you help me out on that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarah Gooding: Uh, you can always find me at the tavern wp tavern.com and I&#8217;m on Twitter at Poly Plummer. I&#8217;m on Mastodon, Facebook, Strava. I&#8217;m on almost every social network, so get ahold of me any way you want. Slack. Um, I&#8217;m on post status and then the WordPress</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Slack. Yes, I&#8217;m on a lot too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anything that doesn&#8217;t have my family, I&#8217;m there. I just wanna also say too special call out to WP Tavern. As far as l i when, I don&#8217;t know when it, I forget when it was established, but it was so early on. I think it&#8217;s, I think WP 2009, it is practically part of WordPress history. It should be put on a podium in terms of, of WordPress history media.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the tavern is, is top of that list. So I really, Sarah, you, we all the WordPress community kind of owes you a debt of gratitude. I know it&#8217;s not an easy job, believe me, I know Jeff was the one who, who started, we&#8217;re gonna have &#8217;em on, on, on the other, on the other podcast. But you have been so instrumental over the years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The entire publication has been instrumental over the years, covering the highs and the lows and the detail for the articles. You did a, did a terrific job. I&#8217;ll think Jeff on the other one. But I wanted to thank you personally here. You&#8217;ve been so much a part of the WordPress history just as much as the community and WordPress has.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sarah Gooding: So thank you David. I appreciate that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Thanks for that. Um, Jess, where people can find you. Oh God, I&#8217;m starting to sound like Yoda. That was barely a sentence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jess Frick: It was great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Where people find you bee,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jess Frick: where people find me bee, pressable.com, uh, pressable.com for work. Um, you can find me on the socials at renew.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Be, and I dunno, like, like the other ladies, I&#8217;m pretty much everywhere, so not hard to find. Okay. Not too many Jessica Fricks running around in WordPress. Oh, well that&#8217;s, that probab not too many Fricks in general, but</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: if, if I had enough energy, I could comment on that. Maestro. I know, Maestro,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jess Frick: I tune it up for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Thank you. And I missed as usual, Maestro, where can people find you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maestro Stevens: I&#8217;ll piggyback off of Jessica. There&#8217;s not many people with the name Maestro Stevens. So if you Google me, I&#8217;m the one and only, um, and if you wanna find me, just look for me on LinkedIn.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>David Bisset: Okay, that&#8217;s fine. Fantastic. You&#8217;re avoiding most of the socials like I should be doing right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, and, um, I, if anybody wants to find me, um, as long as you&#8217;re not delivering papers to me, my, uh, you can find me, um, at david bi.com or David bi.social. Um, that&#8217;s where I pull all my social media into one WordPress website. So in case. Certain social media websites cease to exist, at least my post will be there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also find me on post status and, um, I am doing a little, uh, news website called WP front.page. So, uh, with WordPress News with my daughter as we experiment. A little bit of that, if that&#8217;s, you may be able to, that still might be around by the time you listen to this, so go ahead and check that out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, I want to thank my, my panelists. You&#8217;ve been great sports. We&#8217;re gonna have links to everything they talked about in the show notes for this. Um, and thanks again everybody. Thank you. All right, you have fun.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Today is a little bit of a departure for the podcast. It&#8217;s an episode all about the last 20 years of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;re going to hear a round table discussion with four WordPressers talking about their thoughts on the last 20 years. It features Sarah Gooding, Aurooba Ahmed, Masestro Stevens and Jess Frick, with David Bisset as the discussion moderator.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They cover many topics, and it&#8217;s great to hear so many varied opinions about what&#8217;s been of importance in the evolution of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Notes from David Bisset:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>To honor WordPress’s 20th anniversary I sit down with four community members to talk about some highlights in its history.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Primary topics include: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Memorial WordPress Release</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A WordCamp or WordCamp Experience</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The most notable State of the Word Announcement</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Guests also share other moments that stood out to them and what the future might

6.2.1 was released yesterday and rolled out to sites with automatic background updates enabled. The update included five important security fixes. Ordinarily, a maintenance and security release can be trusted not to break a website, but many users are struggling after 6.2.1 <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/55766\">removed shortcode support from block templates</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/topic/wordpress-v6-2-1-breaks-the-shortcode-block-in-templates/\">support forum thread</a> tracking the broken shortcodes issue shows that this change impacts how plugins display things like breadcrumbs, newsletter signup forms, WPForms, Metaslider, bbPress content, and more. The problem affects template blocks, not sites that are using non-FSE themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It’s absolutely insane to me that shortcodes have been removed by design!&#8221; <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/camknight/\">@camknight</a> said in the support forum discussion. &#8220;Every single one of our agency’s FSE sites uses the shortcode block in templates for everything: filters, search, ACF &amp; plugin integrations. This is chaos!!&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another user, <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/asjl\">@asjl</a>, reports having this update break hundreds of pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I’ve got the same problem on over 600 pages which use five or six different templates with shortcodes in each template on one site and similar things on several others,&#8221; <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/asjl\">@asjl</a> said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I’m looking forward to editing each of those pages to get the shortcode back in place. Or backtracking to 6.2 and turning off updates.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not clear why shortcode blocks that are in block theme template parts still work, but this is one workaround that has been suggested to users. In a trac <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/58333\">ticket</a> for the issue others have suggested adding a PHP file for a plugin called &#8220;Shortcode Fix&#8221; to the plugins folder, but <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/timeline?from=2023-05-17T00%3A42%3A41Z&precision=second\">this workaround</a> reintroduces the security issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Other users are being forced to revert to previous insecure versions of WordPress in order to keep critical functionality on their sites working. WordPress developer Oliver Campion commented on the Trac ticket with more details about how sites are currently using shortcodes in templates:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>This update has been nothing short of a disaster. I cannot understand how there was no warning of such a destructive, automatic roll out!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have managed to rollback affected sites to v6.2 and block automatic core updates until there is a suitable solution, which we hope is imminent due to the reported security issues!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shortcode Blocks, in our opinion, are absolutely essential to the design process when using Block Themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We use them to inject classic menus that can have dynamic menu items (such as sign out), dynamic header content, specialized loops and footer content that’s as simple as showing the current year in the copyright statement to showing a contact form or other such dynamic content. And that’s just what I can think of from the top of my head.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>An unfortunate consequence of this update is that it has destroyed many users&#8217; confidence in WordPress&#8217; automatic updates. This kind of breaking change should never happen in a release that auto installs overnight. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even if it&#8217;s absolutely necessary to avoid a zero-day vulnerability on WordPress sites, discontinued shortcode support in block templates should have been accompanied with more information to help affected users find a solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The only communication users received about this was a short, inadequate note on the vulnerability in the 6.2.1 release post  &#8220;Block themes parsing shortcodes in user generated data.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fixing all of these shortcode uses on websites that heavily rely on them would already have been a challenge for many, even with advance notice. Shipping this breaking change in an automatic update, without a proper explanation of how it impacts users, only served to twist the knife.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During today&#8217;s core dev meeting, WordPress 6.2.1 co-release lead Jb Audras <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C02RQBWTW/p1684354239647849\">said</a> this issue may prompt a quick 6.2.2 release but the details are not yet available.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As you may know, one security fix led to an important issue with shortcodes used in templates,&#8221; Audras said. &#8220;The issue is currently actively discussed in the Security Editor team, and some hypothesis have been made to sort this out in a quick follow-up release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;No schedule available for now &#8211; it will depend on the follow-up patch currently discussed by the Editor team.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, those who cannot employ a workaround and are looking to rollback to 6.2 can can use the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-downgrade/\">WP Downgrade</a> plugin as a temporary fix, with the knowledge that this leaves the site vulnerable until a permanent solution can be put in place.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 17 May 2023 21:13:51 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:84:\"WPTavern: #76 – Alex Standiford on How WordPress and the Fediverse Can Be Combined\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"https://wptavern.com/?post_type=podcast&p=145065\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:98:\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/76-alex-standiford-on-how-wordpress-and-the-fediverse-can-be-combined\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:58465:\"Transcript<div>\n<p>[00:00:00] Nathan Wrigley: Welcome to the Jukebox podcast from WP Tavern. My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case how the Fediverse can be integrated with your WordPress website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast, player of choice. Or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the show, I&#8217;m very keen to hear from you and hopefully get you all your idea featured soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Head over to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jute box and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today we have Alex Standiford. He&#8217;s a web developer originally from Dover, Ohio, and has been tinkering with web technologies for years, but started his career as a web developer in 2015. He&#8217;s a digital nomad, living in a camper with his family for the last three years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alex has built WordPress plugins, websites and web applications, and is an active contributor to the WordPress community, making updates to documentation errors and participating in the organization of WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re a user of social media, it&#8217;s likely that at some point you&#8217;ve signed up for platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and possibly one of the many other options out there. These platforms enable you to post content and have it seen by people all over the world. In effect, this is what your WordPress website does. But we all know that social media has managed to replace the traditional blog for many people. The notion of writing a blog post can seem like a lengthy enterprise. Whereas a social media post is often quicker to write and gets pushed to the platforms users automatically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the podcast, Alex explains how he&#8217;s noticed the shift over time in his own content creation. He&#8217;s put less effort into his WordPress site and has posted most of his ideas on social platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This however is something that Alex has decided to stop doing. For a variety of reasons, he wants to take back control of his own content and make his website the centerpiece of his endeavors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently, Alex stumbled upon Mastodon. It&#8217;s an open source platform which is built on top of the ActivityPub protocol. ActivityPub allows anyone to create their own social networking software, which can interact with any other software using ActivityPub. This is what Mastodon on is, but as you&#8217;ll hear, it&#8217;s not the only software. There are many flavors of ActivityPub, which can all communicate with one another. And this ecosystem is broadly called the Fediverse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alex talks about why he&#8217;s decided to delete many of his old social media accounts in favor of open solutions. And how he&#8217;s using plugins and his own coding skills to make it possible for crossposting of posts and comments between Mastodon on and his WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a really interesting conversation about the recent surge in popularity of these distributed social networks, and how WordPress can become a first class citizen in your digital life; so much more than just a website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast. Where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Alex Standiford.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Alex Standiford. How are you doing, Alex?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:33] Alex Standiford: I&#8217;m great, Nathan, thanks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:35] Nathan Wrigley: This is going to be a conversation which is really up my street. It may be a new project for you if you are listening to this, but it may be something that you are familiar with but haven&#8217;t really dug into.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Over the last six months or so, I&#8217;m going to say, there&#8217;s been a real interest in Mastodon as an alternative social network to Twitter. For a variety of reasons people have brought into question in their own minds whether or not they want to migrate to a different platform. And Mastodon, as we&#8217;re going to find out, is one such platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alex has been doing an awful lot of thinking about how this may work, and combining all of that work with WordPress. But before we get stuck into the weeds of that, Alex, I wonder if you wouldn&#8217;t mind giving us a few moments just to orientate people. Tell us who you are. What company you work for. What projects you&#8217;ve been on. How are you in any way related to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:34] Alex Standiford: Sure. My name&#8217;s Alex. I&#8217;ve been a WordPress developer since 2014. A WordPress user since 2009. I travel full-time with my family and a camper. We go all over the country. We&#8217;ve been doing it for about three years now. And I work for GoDaddy full-time, and then every once in a while I&#8217;ll take on fun little freelance gigs, I call snacks. But aside from that, it&#8217;s mostly just full-time working for GoDaddy and traveling the country, the United States that is. And, you know, thinking about the Fediverse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:03] Nathan Wrigley: Do you want to just encapsulate what the Fediverse is because, I think many people, this may be a new term. It really doesn&#8217;t encapsulate particularly well what it is. So, first question I guess is what is the Fediverse?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:17] Alex Standiford: I kind of wonder if in 10 years they&#8217;re going to look at it, that phrase, in the same way that we looked at the phrase blogosphere, right? Blogosphere, like a while back. It&#8217;s similar to that in a lot of ways. So basically it&#8217;s just where people are, connecting and able to talk to each other socially. Similar to the way that, back then, with a blog post would work. Where you write a blog post and you add an RSS feed and those feeds would integrate with each other and they would like aggregate on different aggregator sites and things like that. Like it was all a part of this way to share content, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, there&#8217;s this newer approach that has the same goal as that, but instead of it using aggregators and RSS feeds, it&#8217;s using a specific protocol that allows all of these different social media platforms to communicate with each other. So you can be on a social media platform that kind of looks like Twitter and you can publish something. And somebody who prefers to use a social media platform that works kind of like Instagram can still see it and interact with it completely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there&#8217;s been a lot of push, and interest in this. Actually Automattic just bought a plugin that would allow WordPress to actually integrate and become a part of this system too. So it would basically align with that protocol, and make it possible to allow a WordPress post to be seen natively on anybody&#8217;s social media account, as long as they&#8217;re a part of, as long as whatever system they&#8217;re using uses that protocol.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So again, if I publish something on WordPress, somebody who&#8217;s using a Twitter like experience for social media, could see that post. Respond to it through their app, through their social media account, and it would actually read as a reply on that blog post as a comment. And that if you responded to it, it would then turn around and go back to that person&#8217;s post and send them a response. So it allows you to kind of integrate these different ways of publishing content all together with a single cohesive approach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:16] Nathan Wrigley: So I guess Fedi is short for Federation, and the idea is that you can combine multiple different outlets, multiple different sources, and have them all communicating with each other. Now, it&#8217;s interesting, you mentioned Twitter a couple of times there. You said Twitter like, and I guess that&#8217;s an important distinction to draw.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we were to rewind the clock, let&#8217;s say 15 years, I think it&#8217;s fairly likely that many of us, if we were into technology and into the internet, our reach there probably would&#8217;ve been our own website, our own blog. And we would&#8217;ve written content there. And that worked. And as you said, there were ways of connecting your content with other people&#8217;s content, but it was log into website, click publish, and you&#8217;re done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But slowly the march of convenience and what became known as social media, really, I think for many people, made that something that they didn&#8217;t want to bother in. Because all of a sudden they discovered that all of their friends, relations, colleagues, everybody, were beginning to talk about these proprietary platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We may talk about Facebook or Twitter, but everybody moved over there and the convenience was, well, everybody&#8217;s there. So you can post things and it can be seen by your friends, colleagues, relations, but it can also be seen by complete strangers. So you have that capability.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this seems to be a reaction to that. Now, it may not be, it may be that this technology, the Fediverse and what underpins it, it is just as old. I don&#8217;t know, hopefully you can answer that. But it does seem to be a reaction to that because it has certain different characteristics and features which may be of interest to people who are getting, for want of a better word, fed up with traditional social media. So, I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve got anything to add to that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:06] Alex Standiford: Yeah, so that&#8217;s pretty much right. So the ActivityPub protocol, it&#8217;s not as old, it&#8217;s newer. But it&#8217;s still several years old. But it&#8217;s relatively new compared to the other technologies you&#8217;re talking about there. A lot of the reason why it was created was exactly that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The fact that people don&#8217;t want to be isolated and in these individual silos. They want to be able to break out of that and talk to each other. And we kind of lost that between 2007 and 2012, right? Like right at that time where Facebook and Twitter and this true sense of social media really exploded was right at the same time as WordPress blogging was exploding.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they were all kind of feeding off of each other. And WordPress was, and always has been very open-minded and open focused. It wants to integrate. It wants to be a part of the party. But it doesn&#8217;t necessarily want to take over. And then you had all these other social media platforms that we&#8217;re doing the opposite of that. They want to take over and they did, right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So eventually it got to the point to where, you know, you&#8217;re not even publishing content on your blog anymore, you&#8217;re just publishing it directly on Twitter or something like that. Because a tweet doesn&#8217;t make sense. If you think about it, the original, one of the original intents of a tweet was for it to be this ephemeral, quick little update.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It wasn&#8217;t really of any serious significant consequence. It was just a little update to let people know, to be in support of blog posts or something that was a longer form that you would write, like an essay or something related to things. Say you&#8217;re going on a trip somewhere and you&#8217;re publishing tweets, right? I call them micro posts now because I&#8217;ve generalized the term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you&#8217;re sending out four or five tweets throughout the day, as you&#8217;re doing things and having this experience. It&#8217;s almost like you&#8217;re micro blogging, right? That&#8217;s literally what it was called. But the idea was that you would then come back and take all that stuff and put it on your blog as a single cohesive complete blog post. But people just stopped doing that. They just skipped that step, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they would just publish these little tweets, and then all of a sudden WordPress became more of a marketing tool than it did a personal tool to be able to provide personal updates. And that&#8217;s kind of a big thing that I&#8217;ve been thinking about lately is like, how can we make WordPress personal again?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because a lot of the people who are using it now are companies, right, businesses. And that&#8217;s great. That&#8217;s an amazing facet of it. But if you look at just WordPress, if you just install WordPress and you just use it as a publishing platform for yourself, it is truly delightful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even the block editor and everything about it. If you just take everything away and, you know, you&#8217;re not trying to install WooCommerce, or Yoast SEO or all these other fancy plugins or anything, anything at all. You&#8217;re just installing WordPress and you&#8217;re just using it to publish content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is actually really awesome. And we&#8217;ve gotten away from that a lot, and I think that this social media stuff and being able to change how we look at our blog can allow us to, not only make more use of our own personal site, but it&#8217;ll also allow us to be able to prioritize the content on our site as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:01] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, we&#8217;ll come to all of those different pieces. But one of the things that occurs to me, when people talk about WordPress and building websites on top of WordPress, one of the things that is often touted is, you need to own your content. It needs to be yours. You don&#8217;t want to be behind some sort of gatekeeper who you have no control over. So in the event that that website or that service is shut down, then all of your content disappears.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And although we&#8217;ve seemed to have settled down, there&#8217;s three or four different rival proprietary social networks out there, which have seemed to have got to the point where they&#8217;re economically sustainable In that journey, I must have signed up to a dozen or more social networks, in air quotes, that just collapsed. You know, they didn&#8217;t make it, and any content that I put there disappeared.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s that. But I totally get the point that you make about the fact that people have stopped using, or stopped thinking about using their WordPress website as the centerpiece of all of their content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After all, why not just go to Facebook, Twitter, et cetera, and post it there because the audience is already ready made. All of the people are there. But the piece in the jigsaw, which I feel is the clincher for many people who enjoy the Fediverse is the desire to shun the algorithm which is now in existence on those platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you went to the original Facebook and the original Twitter, you had a very different experience to the one that you have now. Now it&#8217;s, there&#8217;s a very complicated algorithm, which in all honesty, I doubt many people understand. But it&#8217;s able to put content in front of you, and I guess some people begin to question, well, why that piece of content? Is it because I&#8217;m really likely to be genuinely interested in that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or is it because that piece of content is likely to engage me further, suck me in further, and make me stay here for a bit longer? And certainly in my life, I&#8217;ve noticed that you get to the end of the day and you analyze what you&#8217;ve achieved that day. And many, many times I&#8217;ve thought to myself, well, I probably spent quite a lot of that day scrolling through things that ultimately I didn&#8217;t want to see, but the algorithm is so sublimely good, that I&#8217;ve ended up staying there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there&#8217;s that piece as well. There&#8217;s that piece, that wish to get away from the algorithm. And so the Fediverse, or at least the technology behind the Fediverse that I&#8217;ve seen thus far, really pushes away the algorithm. It&#8217;s not that. It&#8217;s a linear feed of content and it comprises only of the people that you follow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s no clever system trying to game your attention. It&#8217;s just here&#8217;s what you&#8217;ve subscribed to follow. If you unfollow people, you see nothing. And if you follow people, you see their things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:46] Alex Standiford: Right. I heard somebody refer to Twitter as a content refinery. Or not just Twitter, but all the major ones. So Twitter, Facebook, TikTok, all these, as a content refinery. They&#8217;re not necessarily there to give you the content you want. They&#8217;re there to just give you content. And sometimes that&#8217;s not a bad thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think Chris Coyier, he posted something not long ago that was a really good, I thought it was a really good perspective on it. He said that sometimes he wants the intentional read. He wants the intentional RSS feed and the non algorithmic approach, right? Where it&#8217;s like, this is what I want to look at. I want to be intentional with my choices here. But it&#8217;s a more high energy take on consumption.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then he said, but there&#8217;s also times where I&#8217;m like, I&#8217;ve worked all day. I&#8217;m exhausted. And I want to just sit down and chill and watch some funny epic fails on Instagram and scroll for 45 minutes or so. It&#8217;s like low energy. It&#8217;s like, I&#8217;m letting the algorithm just entertain me, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s not any different than channel surfing or anything like that from the past. But I think it has a place, and I think it&#8217;s separate from where you read your newspaper. They&#8217;re two different things. So, I&#8217;m not necessarily opposed to the idea of an algorithm in Mastodon even. I just don&#8217;t think, I don&#8217;t like that it&#8217;s black box. I want to know how it works. I want to be able to control it and customize it to suit my needs. It should be a tool, not a thing that shoved on me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:08] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. It is interesting because I imagine there&#8217;s a proportion of people listening to this who will not have heard of the Fediverse and think, oh, that&#8217;s curious. Okay, I&#8217;m interested in exploring that. And equally, there&#8217;ll be a whole bunch of people who say, well, I&#8217;m very happy with the way that Twitter and Facebook and so on serve me content at the moment. It works to my needs and, there&#8217;s no sense of pushing one thing over another, but I guess the impetus of this episode is to explain a little bit about how all that works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which leads perfectly to that question. How does this technology work? What is underpinning it? You mentioned ActivityPub, but also I suppose we should get into the whole disparate nature of it. The fact that this is not one thing. It&#8217;s a bunch of people owning servers independently who connect together. So, if you could get into the how it works piece, that would be good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:56] Alex Standiford: Sure. So, like I said earlier, all of these different social media, pieces of social media software, right? So a Twitter like experience, Instagram like experience, a Facebook like experience, a Medium even, just Medium actually, but different places. They all ultimately integrate with a protocol called ActivityPub.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And basically to put it really simple, it&#8217;s a standardized way to be able to communicate between these things. So it&#8217;s kind of like REST API, but also on top of that, there&#8217;s this very specific set of ways to describe content. It&#8217;s kinda like RSS. A lot like RSS in that way where, you know, an RSS feed it has a content tag and a title tag and an author tag. Everybody can use these however you see fit. Whatever fits best for you. Whatever your content is in that spot, put it there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it works in that same way, but it also, on top of the consumption perspective, it also works with the ability to be able to interact as well. So it&#8217;s a better version of that. So you end up with other standardized things to be able to like describe a response to this and describe what the content is, and the body and all those other details. I could get into the, more of the complexities of it beyond that, but that&#8217;s the gist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you have this protocol and then Mastodon, which is the Twitter like experience, uses this platform to be able to just talk to the other platforms. Pixelfed, for example, for an Instagram like experience. Or PeerTube even for YouTube.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you have all these different ones and then, each one of these, that&#8217;s just the software, right? So if you think about it like WordPress, because even WordPress can fit into this category too, of different pieces of software that work with the ActivityPub. But you still need hosting. You still need to be able to host it, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So some of these software, they&#8217;re built to work like Twitter or Instagram, where it&#8217;s one server and it&#8217;s hosting thousands of people. And obviously it&#8217;s impractical. One server can&#8217;t hold the entirety of Twitter&#8217;s accounts. To be able to do this in a way that doesn&#8217;t require ads and allows people to be able to volunteer and donate and support it, is they break it down into smaller servers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So instead of it being one single piece of Mastodon software runs Mastodon for everybody, it&#8217;s several thousand servers are all running the Mastodon software and they&#8217;re all talking to each other, exactly like they would as if using the ActivityPub protocol.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, you&#8217;ve got Mastodon that has all these servers and they&#8217;re all talking to each other through what&#8217;s called Federation, right. Through this protocol, back and forth. And then they&#8217;re also able to talk with other servers that are running different software. Because they don&#8217;t really care what the software is. All they care about is the protocol, and they&#8217;re all able to just connect with each other and talk. And that&#8217;s really what the Fediverse is, in the technical sense.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:53] Nathan Wrigley: I feel that one of the difficulties that I&#8217;ve experienced anyway, with people trying to get on board the Fediverse, is they have this notion that because Facebook&#8217;s a platform and you are always going to facebook.com to log in. And the same for Twitter. It&#8217;s a little bit of a, there&#8217;s a bit of cognitive dissonance going on when you realize, well, I can&#8217;t go to mastodon.com and sign up for an account over there. I need to go to some other smaller entity. But that&#8217;s the point. There&#8217;s loads of them, thousands of them, as you described. They all talk to each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you&#8217;ve got to, you&#8217;ve got to pick a place to begin. But one of the things that you can do is you can port your account, you can move it from a particular server to another server. But also, because of the free and open source nature of the software, certain servers can decide rules for themselves, which may be exactly what you want to hear. It may be music to your ears that this particular server, allows this kind of content, but not this kind of content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This particular server will communicate with this one, but we&#8217;ve made a decision for various reasons that the content that&#8217;s being created over on that server is something that we don&#8217;t want to see. So it adds all that complexity, but with that complexity comes some wonderful benefits I feel as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:11] Alex Standiford: For sure. And also, and then if you end up with a bunch of bad actors who spin up a server and they&#8217;re trying to like, cause some kind of problem. Cause some drama or spread false information or something through the Fediverse. All the different servers, they can look at that one and say, this server is full of people who are not doing anything but causing problems for my server. I&#8217;m blocking this server. This server can no longer communicate with my server at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they call it fedi locking. So, what&#8217;s happened a couple of times, this is before me, I&#8217;m still relatively new to all this, but they&#8217;ve had a few scenarios where that exact scenario has happened. Where somebody spun up a server and they were publishing a whole bunch of just garbage, and all the other servers talked to each other, not automatically, but like literally the administrators and everybody were just communicating about the content that was flowing from that place. And said, yeah, this is a problem, we&#8217;ve got to block it. So everybody just blocked it at once and it just completely shut that server down. And it&#8217;s like a fire, you know what I mean? You smother it and it just dies and it goes away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:12] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah. I guess it&#8217;s important to emphasize there that each server is run by an administrator, several administrators, it depends. So it&#8217;s on the server level that that blocking takes place. It&#8217;s not like this cabal of people got together and said, Mastodon, ActivityPub will block this server. No, they&#8217;re blocking it on their own server, the one that they&#8217;re in charge of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:23:36] Alex Standiford: Right. So if you liked that content for whatever reason, you can be on a server that doesn&#8217;t block it. But the thing I really want to talk about today is the idea of taking this a little bit further and owning your content again, right? Bringing it all back to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Publishing on social media is fantastic. It&#8217;s been an amazing change for me at least. I&#8217;m sure it has been for you, like, it&#8217;s been transformative in how I approach being able to talk to people. I&#8217;ve met so many people as a result of it. It&#8217;s been so good for my career and everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, the problem is that I, like I said, I stopped publishing on my blog and I stopped doing that because I was putting my blog on a pedestal. I would say this content isn&#8217;t good enough for my blog. This is just a little 25 word post with a picture. This is a small update about me. This isn&#8217;t good enough for my blog. I&#8217;m just going to go throw this on Twitter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And what ended up happening was I would publish something on my site once every six months or so. Granted, it&#8217;s polished. It&#8217;s a great article and I&#8217;m proud of everything I&#8217;ve written, well, proud of most things that I&#8217;ve written. But it was so infrequent, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So my site no longer was the singular place where I would send people. I got to the point to where I was basically sending people to my Twitter account instead of my personal site. You know, it makes sense because I am inadvertently creating and publishing the most authentic version of myself on Twitter. On social media. Which is just crazy when I say it out loud.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If 13 year old me knew that I was capable of building a website and building my own cool little space that was just mine, and didn&#8217;t belong to anybody else, and I wasn&#8217;t publishing absolutely every dang thing that I ever published about myself anywhere but there first, I would&#8217;ve been mad at myself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I was 13, I had a, it was like a, I don&#8217;t know, it was one of those frost fire sites or something. I can&#8217;t remember. It was like a self-hosted. It wasn&#8217;t even self-hosted. It was like you go there, you sign up and you have like frostfire.com/service, or Alex or something. Anyway, it was crazy, right? It had GIFs of like clouds in the background and there was music playing on it. It was terrible because I was a kid and I didn&#8217;t know anything about web design, but I loved it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I would go to that all the time and I would check it out and I was like, this is mine. I&#8217;m doing this for me, and I want you to see it, but this is mine. I feel like I&#8217;ve gotten away from that over the years where now I&#8217;m, well not now, but up to recently, I was looking at my site and saying, this is a brand, this is a product. This is for me to be able to put the best stuff on and nothing else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, it wasn&#8217;t an overly personal site. It wasn&#8217;t a, it was just a site that felt inauthentic. It wasn&#8217;t me. And it really bothered me whenever I made that realization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:31] Nathan Wrigley: So in the future that you are imagining, and some of the pieces of this puzzle probably exist already, but some of the pieces of the puzzle that we are going to lay out, have still yet to be created. But the Fediverse allows you to choose to have WordPress as the fulcrum, the centerpiece of Alex&#8217;s digital life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you are imagining a scenario where you could publish things on WordPress. Obviously WordPress has a commenting system. But that content could then be sent to other platforms. Let&#8217;s imagine Mastodon, for example. It could be read over there. But equally, any commentary that happened over on Mastodon would come back and be reflected on your website. And so in this way, the website becomes the centerpiece of it all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:24] Alex Standiford: Yeah, exactly. You publish on your site and it syndicates everywhere else. And that&#8217;s where I&#8217;ve come to, right? So I had a design of my site prior to this one, my current one. It was just a single React site that I built that, all it did was it grabbed content I published from all the different blogs that I publish on. And it pulled them in and it put them on a single feed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The idea was I wanted this site to be as easy to maintain as possible. I don&#8217;t want to mess with it. I want it to just be automatic where I publish content. Wherever I publish it, I want it to show up on my site. And I&#8217;ve realized that that&#8217;s kind of backwards, and I want to flip that and get to the point to where I&#8217;m publishing content from my site, and then having it go out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, the reason why I didn&#8217;t pursue that, and I instead was focused on ingesting that content, bringing it into my site, was because platforms like Twitter and Facebook and Instagram make it very difficult to integrate with them in a way that allows you to be able to obtain that public data, right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m publishing a tweet. It&#8217;s public. It&#8217;s available to the public, and yet I can&#8217;t publicly access that stuff via a REST API or an RSS feed or anything like that. Because one, they&#8217;re trying to manage their integrations and trying to maintain their servers to make sure that it doesn&#8217;t get abused.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But really what it is, is they just don&#8217;t want you to do that. You know what I mean? They don&#8217;t want you to be able to have that. They want you on their platform. They want you looking at ads. They want you there. And for a couple of years now, because I actually hadn&#8217;t even heard of the Fediverse. I&#8217;d been thinking about all this stuff. I hadn&#8217;t heard about any of this, and I was like, man, I really hate this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, I want to publish on my site first. It was bugging me, driving me nuts, right. And then the Elon Musk, the purchase rather, last year happened and I literally tweeted, because I still even at this moment, didn&#8217;t know about the Fediverse at all. I was like, hey, we&#8217;re developers. Why don&#8217;t we fix this? I&#8217;ve been thinking about this for a long time. I would love to be able to fix this specific problem where I&#8217;m not publishing on my site. I don&#8217;t want to be on Twitter anymore. How can we fix this?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And somebody was like, well, why don&#8217;t you just use Mastodon? I looked it up and I looked into it, and it was over. That instant, literally that day I switched over. I made an, my entire day was lost. I switched over, I made account. I deleted all my tweets. I exported everything. I deleted all my tweets. I changed my profile name to my Mastodon handle, and added a description and said, I&#8217;ve moved, I haven&#8217;t looked back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I haven&#8217;t missed it. I don&#8217;t want it. That&#8217;s not what I want to be. I want my content to come from my website, and I knew that that requires open protocols, open source software, and staying away from these siloed, closed source places like Twitter and Facebook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if I&#8217;m being honest, as a open source WordPress developer, as a person who believes in WordPress and believes in the promise that publishing content should be available for everybody, and things like that. And being able to access and work with that data should be open and, all the fundamental open source values. I have to be on Mastodon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s not even a choice, right? Because it&#8217;s simply either you do, you mean it, right? You mean that. You believe this and support this. Or you don&#8217;t. Because if you&#8217;re on Twitter, you don&#8217;t. I just don&#8217;t think you do, because you&#8217;re using a closed source platform to be able to publish content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You may be telling yourself that you&#8217;re not, but ultimately you are. And it is completely contrary to WordPress. It doesn&#8217;t want WordPress to exist. It only allows it to exist because it has to and it can&#8217;t get rid of it. Whereas open source things, they want it. They invite it. They welcome this as a part of the whole.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even from an identity perspective, that&#8217;s where it hit me. It hit me all the way down to like my very identity on social media. And I was like, I can&#8217;t be on Twitter now that I know this exists. I literally can&#8217;t be. It&#8217;s not even a matter of what&#8217;s better or not. I just can&#8217;t do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:22] Nathan Wrigley: If we were to try and implement some of the bits and pieces that you&#8217;ve just described, this kind of bidirectional relationship with the Fediverse, Mastodon or Pixelfed or whatever it be. And so you, can push content from WordPress out there, but also that you can consume content from the Fediverse back into, let&#8217;s say, a commenting system on a WordPress post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How is that achieved? Now, I know that the goalposts here are moving all the time. It seems like there&#8217;s a whole tranche of developers who are really interested in this and are proposing different things, and there&#8217;s different plugins that are trying to tackle this. Given that we&#8217;re recording this towards the latter part of the beginning of 2023, and caveat emptor, who knows what the state of play will be when anybody listens this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given all of that, what are the plugins that are spiking your interest? It may not be plugins, it may be something else. What are the solutions that you can point people towards to make this possible in a WordPress site?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:20] Alex Standiford: You can do it today with the ActivityPub plugin, and that&#8217;s the one that Automattic just purchased recently. They hired a person full-time to be able to take it on and maintain it. Well, actually they hired the developer, the person who built it and just said, going to hire you and you&#8217;re just going to work on this, right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It will do those things you&#8217;re talking about. The problem with that plugin, at least today, and I know that this is something that they want to improve. But at least today, the problem is you can&#8217;t actually build a social media feed from it. And what I mean by that is, your blog will have an account, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So anybody can follow your blog account, your website&#8217;s account. Just by going to your address which is basically your username at your account, your website.com, right? But they can access it and they can see the content and they can follow it, they can comment on it, they can boost it, they can do all the things that you can normally do with it on the Fediverse. And you can interact with the comments and how people respond to it. But you personally can&#8217;t follow other people and view their content using your website right now. That to me is kind of the killer limitation that has stopped me from doing that today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:34] Nathan Wrigley: It&#8217;s around the content creation process, not the exploration of what other people are producing. It&#8217;s about you producing and receiving commentary, but not exploring what everybody else is producing, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:46] Alex Standiford: Right, as I understand it, there&#8217;s a hope that we can get to the point to where both sides of that, both the discovery and the writing side can all happen in a single, cohesive place. But it doesn&#8217;t quite exist yet. That&#8217;s kind of the big, for me personally, that&#8217;s the big limiting factor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A lot of people get around it by having a social media account and then manually boosting everything they publish after they publish it. I think that defeats the purpose. But I am doing something that&#8217;s not terribly different, to be honest. The conclusion that I ended up coming to was, I&#8217;m publishing everything on my site, including social media posts and everything.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m using a plugin, I can&#8217;t remember the name right now. Let me find it real quick. It&#8217;s called Share on Mastodon. That was pretty easy. So there&#8217;s a plugin called Share on Mastodon that allows you to automatically cross publish content that you publish on your site onto Mastodon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, these things exist or existed for Twitter and Instagram and all those other ones. But again, on a closed platform, they&#8217;re kind of difficult to work with and they can just go away at any time. But that&#8217;s neither here nor there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Share on Mastodon plugin will automatically cross publish content you post on your site onto Mastodon. You can filter it. You can customize how the content is published. What format it is, and all that stuff through the plugin via a filter, or several filters really. It&#8217;ll even scan the content and grab the images from the content and attach them in the posts and things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s been my solution. As of right now, I am active on Mastodon and that&#8217;s it. I don&#8217;t plan on being active anywhere else anytime soon. If I do, it&#8217;ll be on another platform on the Fediverse. But to be honest, there&#8217;s not a huge reason to do it. Once you pick the software you like, the feed can ultimately be the same people. You know what I mean? I&#8217;m not there yet. I&#8217;m finding plenty of people coming to the Mastodon. I&#8217;m good with that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve got my site personally set up to do that. It&#8217;ll auto publish content. But then the other challenge that I ran into with this is the mobile experience, right. Because I&#8217;m not going to open up my website through my phone, open up a post, click add post, and like go through this whole process to be able to publish a micro post, a social media post, right? It&#8217;s supposed to be this small quick thing that just takes a second. I mean, Twitter, originally you were literally texting a phone number, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s why the character counts exist. Limits existed originally and stuff. It was a technical reason. It was because you were just texting a phone number and that added a tweet. So it&#8217;s always supposed to be this quick, you whip out your pocket, something out of your pocket and you send a text message and it should be that quick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So to have to go through all of that, I already know that&#8217;s a non-starter. If I have to do that, this is never going to work. So I actually had to design my site around the limitations of the WordPress app today. Which to me, I think is getting that better is as important as getting the connections and everything to the Fediverse setup. Because it&#8217;s very limited on what it can do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use posts. It supports the block editor, and it&#8217;s fantastic. Don&#8217;t get me wrong. The editing experience is great, but it&#8217;s limited. I can&#8217;t customize that app at all. So whatever that app has in it are the tools that I can use inside a WordPress, to be able to solve my problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That means I can&#8217;t use custom post types. That means I can&#8217;t use custom blocks. I can&#8217;t use custom sidebar widgets inside of the block editor to be able to organize or change my content. I can use categories. I can use tags. And weirdly enough I can use post formats. And that&#8217;s it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I designed my site to support those, to use those. I&#8217;m actually using post formats on my site. It is the weirdest thing. I don&#8217;t love it. I&#8217;m okay with it, it&#8217;s fine. But I would much rather have a custom post type with a block editor template, right? So that I could create like a image post type and be able to click on it. It&#8217;ll just be a fixed template with an image and a paragraph for me to be able to add text. Like, I would like to lock it down like that, but I can&#8217;t do any of that stuff because I&#8217;m limited by what the WordPress app allows me to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So with those two things, basically now I am whipping out my phone, opening up the WordPress app, tapping on post, clicking, add new posts, typing in my content. And then I&#8217;m setting the post format to aside and adding my tags and hitting publish. And I have a little action that runs in the background that automatically, with that plugin, Share to Mastodon plugin, I&#8217;m hooked into that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So whenever my content publishes, if the post format&#8217;s aside, if it&#8217;s a micro post, it automatically shares the body, all of the content in that post. And then it&#8217;ll automatically parse the tags as hashtags. And then it also shares a link to the original posts, as well. So that happens. But then if it&#8217;s an actual blog post, right, it&#8217;ll just take the excerpt and it&#8217;ll do the same thing, but it&#8217;ll take the excerpt instead. Share a link to the original post and the hashtags.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:38:46] Nathan Wrigley: So, being a developer, you&#8217;ve been able to conjure up ingenious, by the sounds of it, ways of overcoming the problems of sharing different types of content. But it feels like that solution is something which you would desire, well, maybe to build yourself, I don&#8217;t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:39:03] Alex Standiford: Yeah. The spirit is willing, but the time, there&#8217;s only so many hours. The problem with this is that my theme that I&#8217;m using, it&#8217;s a custom theme. Now, it&#8217;s not a crazy, I mean, okay, yeah, it&#8217;s a pretty crazy setup. It&#8217;s way beyond what a typical person should be expected to use and set up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is mine, 13 year old me, right? This is mine. It&#8217;s for me. I&#8217;m having fun with it. I&#8217;m going to put all kinds of crazy stuff in this. I&#8217;m going to overbuild the crap out of it just because I can, and I want to. But, just a more practical look at this. The big problem with what I just said is the post formats because very few themes, if any themes at all, support post formats today. Because they were marked as, they basically killed them off, right, in favor of custom post types.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then they never actually added support for custom post types in the app. So here we are. So you&#8217;re kind of in this weird catch 22 where if you want to do this, you have to figure out how to allow your blog, your website, to be able to actually support post formats again. Which, that isn&#8217;t hard. Actually just telling it, hey, I want to use post formats on posts. That&#8217;s not a big deal. That&#8217;s like four lines of code, no big deal. The problem is the theme support, right? The actual, whenever you&#8217;re going through the loop, actually setting it up to be able to recognize those different post formats and to display them appropriately is a challenge, right? Actually integrating it with the actual content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:30] Nathan Wrigley: It feels at the moment as if, whilst it&#8217;s a lot of fun, you are also saying, it&#8217;s a lot of fun for somebody like me. In the sense that, you know, you&#8217;re a developer, you can overcome these problems. Given all of that, is there still right at this point in time, is there still a benefit do you think, in just throwing on the plugins that are freely available at the moment and going for it, and just working with the limitations?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because, again I think if I cast my mind back to the beginning of Twitter. Twitter was nothing like what it is now. It took years and years and years for people to figure out what Twitter would be. For Twitter to figure out what Twitter would be. Facebook the same. It went through this iterative process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remember the Twitter fail whale. It was just a hot mess. 50% of the time, everything I tried to do just died. And so maybe it needs to be viewed with that approach. Yes, you may wish to be a part of the Fediverse, but we&#8217;re at the beginning of the evolution. We haven&#8217;t fully conceived of what that might be. And in the year 2023, 2024, that will become a little bit more solidified. But jump in, have a go with what&#8217;s available right now, developer or no.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:36] Alex Standiford: Yeah, I think so. If for no other reason than this. I always told myself that I didn&#8217;t care about the content I was posting on Twitter. Like I didn&#8217;t care a lot about it. I was just posting it because it was easy to post things there. I cared about being a part of a conversation. I treated it like a Slack chat, right? Where it&#8217;s, truly this thing that&#8217;s just going to go away. I don&#8217;t really care if I never see it again, that&#8217;s fine. But Twitter&#8217;s not that, it&#8217;s not. Content never goes away as we&#8217;ve seen, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I found that I was, this became especially true whenever we started traveling in the camper because, I was posting all these cool things. These cool like little moments that would happen. Like, I&#8217;ll give you an example. I had a, I was in Taos last summer, and it was like three in the morning, and these donkeys woke us up. And we&#8217;re at my door, and I was like, what are these donkeys doing here? It&#8217;s three in the morning. And I whipped out my phone. I recorded a video. I published a tweet. Didn&#8217;t think anything of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, of course that tweet became something that I was linking back to and referencing all the dang time. I didn&#8217;t think anything of that at the time. It didn&#8217;t matter. But then I decided I didn&#8217;t want to be on Twitter and I wanted to leave, and all of a sudden I&#8217;m deciding I&#8217;m deleting all my tweets. And I&#8217;m losing all that. Right, I gave up all that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now I have all that stuff and I hope to someday maybe be able to put it back on my site. But the point is, I wasn&#8217;t owning my content. I wasn&#8217;t doing it right. I wasn&#8217;t doing it well enough. I thought I was, because I was saving the super shiny, amazing blog posts, but I wasn&#8217;t sharing my most authentic self on my site. I wasn&#8217;t even sharing all of my content that I clearly cared about, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I thought I didn&#8217;t care about it because I thought that Twitter was just a place for me to chat with people. But it proved to be very much not the case. So now, if nothing else, even if you&#8217;re manually, I mean, for weeks I was manually publishing on WordPress and then turning around and posting it on Mastodon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was doing this manually, and if you literally just hide, you could add a filter onto a theme that doesn&#8217;t support it, and just hide all of the posts that aren&#8217;t, like your aside post type. So, if it&#8217;s a micro post, maybe it literally just doesn&#8217;t show up on your site today. You could still do it, and it would just look funny because it wouldn&#8217;t have a title, but some themes it might look fine. You never know, maybe a couple CSS tweaks and it looks great. But, I think it&#8217;s worth it for no other reason other than owning your content and being true to that fact, right? And truly believing and knowing that you have your stuff and it&#8217;s yours, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, my family doesn&#8217;t follow me on Twitter, right? So I had this really cool moment the other day where I shared a personal update about my son and, my site is set up to where my WordPress site happens to also be set up to where it&#8217;s a single WordPress website, but it&#8217;s actually. three different websites that are on the front end. So it&#8217;s actually managing, casualweirdness.life, alexstandiford.com and eventually it&#8217;ll also be managing, WP Dev Academy. So all three of these sites are running through this single site, and it&#8217;s just querying the data based on what site it needs to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So with that, I&#8217;m actually able to not only publish content across the Fediverse, but I&#8217;m also able to publish this personal update. And since it&#8217;s a personal update and it&#8217;s detected that it is, because it&#8217;s using a specific tag, it also automatically just shows up on the feed on casual awareness&#8217; site too, which is a more personal lifestyle blog of my family and me, compared to alexstandiford.com, which is a more holistic look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it was really cool because I had this post, right, I published it, and I was able to send it and just share from alexstandiford.com, this is a post from me about me, that I want to share with you and it&#8217;s got a video on it. I know that seems silly, but there was just something really cool about being able to just share something on a personal level with my family, because I&#8217;ve never done that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s always been the blog is the business, right? The blog is buttoned up. I&#8217;m not sharing this content with my family because nobody gives a crap about WordPress until they suddenly decide they want to start a business. So, to be able to just use my site beyond networking needs, and be able to just share it, something like that with my family was really cool. It was this like first moment where I really felt that my site was like an intimate, personal thing, not just a tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:48] Nathan Wrigley: You really have gone into the weeds of this, haven&#8217;t you? It&#8217;s fascinating listening to all of this, and all of the different ways you&#8217;ve got of consuming the content from three different websites and I would encourage anybody who likes UI and UX, to go and click the little clock icon on the top right of Alex&#8217;s website. You&#8217;re in for a surprise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:05] Alex Standiford: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:07] Nathan Wrigley: That is something else, bravo. That&#8217;s fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:09] Alex Standiford: Thank you. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:11] Nathan Wrigley: One of the things that I suppose people get onto social media for, is for reach. And for that content that they&#8217;re producing to be seen by a bunch of people. How do we feel that&#8217;s going on the Fediverse? For my part, the graph just keeps going up. The user base keeps growing up. Is it logarithmic? No. It&#8217;s more of a linear growth, but it&#8217;s growth nevertheless. What&#8217;s your feeling on that? Because I feel that some people think, well, I can&#8217;t let go of Twitter because I have this business. I&#8217;ve built up a reputation there. I don&#8217;t want to lose all of that. Do you see people moving over slowly? Is that a trend?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:43] Alex Standiford: So to answer your question first off, I see more. I see a lot more. Honestly, I saw a lot more in December. It was just almost instantaneous. And maybe it&#8217;s because I found the right server and the right people when I was talking about the right subjects. I&#8217;m not sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It could also just be simply because I joined right at the same time as everybody, a lot of other people who were joining, who were excited about it, and we were all talking about it together. But even now, now that things have calmed down, relatively speaking. I don&#8217;t even notice a difference in terms of engagement, but I can tell you that for a while, I was cross-posting both on Mastodon and Twitter at the same time for a few weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And every post on Mastodon was consistently getting more engagement than it was on Twitter. And I have half the followers on Mastodon as I do on Twitter. So it&#8217;s definitely more for me. I have like 1800 followers on Twitter, and I think last time I checked I had somewhere around 700 on Mastodon. And it was still, two to three times as much engagement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:47:37] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, that&#8217;s amazing. It definitely seems to be growing. We&#8217;ll have to see how this whole Fediverse thing pans out, but it&#8217;s, for the moment at least, it&#8217;s very, very exciting. I do like the idea of creating some system where WordPress sits at the center of all of that, and the ability to create content over there and see it, see the impact of it inside of your WordPress website. Even though the impact, the commentary or whatever, was happening elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If people are interested in this, Alex, and they want to reach out to you because it can be confusing. There&#8217;s a lot of strange pitfalls along the way. What are the best places to reach out to you? Don&#8217;t say Twitter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:48:16] Alex Standiford: alexstandiford.com of course, is my personal site. So, I&#8217;ve got several blog posts I&#8217;ve written. You&#8217;re invited to ask questions as a comment on there. You can also just reach out to me on the Fediverse on Mastadon. I am @alexstandiford@fosstodon.org. That&#8217;s, you know, a perfectly fine spot to message me to. I check that pretty often. Of course, I&#8217;m on Slack on several different channels like Post Status, so I&#8217;m on Make WordPress as well. You can just message me directly on there too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:48:42] Nathan Wrigley: Alex, I hope that we&#8217;ll be able to say when 2024 rolls around that this has taken off. Let&#8217;s see how it all lies in a year&#8217;s time. Thank you so much for chatting to us about the Fediverse today. I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:48:55] Alex Standiford: Yeah, no problem. I appreciate your time. Thanks.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://alexstandiford.com/\">Alex Standiford</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He’s a web developer originally from Dover, Ohio, and has been tinkering with web technologies for years, but started his career as a web developer in 2015. He’s a digital nomad, living in a camper with his family for the last three years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alex has built WordPress plugins, websites, and web applications, and is an active contributor to the WordPress community, making updates to documentation errors, and participating in the organisation of WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are a user of social media, it’s likely that at some point you’ve signed up for platforms like Twitter, Facebook and possibly one of the many other options out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These platforms enable you to post content and have it seen by people all over the world. In effect, this is what your WordPress website does, but we all know that social media has managed to replace the traditional blog for many people. The notion of writing a blog post can seem like a lengthy enterprise, whereas a social media post is often quicker to write and gets pushed to the platform&#8217;s users automatically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the podcast Alex explains how he’s noticed this shift over time in his own content creation. He’s put less effort into his WordPress site and has posted most of his ideas on social platforms. This however is something that Alex has decided to stop doing. For a variety of reasons he wants to take back control of his own content and make his website the centrepiece of his endeavours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Recently Alex stumbled upon the Mastodon. It’s an open source platform which is built on top of the ActivityPub protocol. ActivityPub allows anyone to create their own social networking software which can interact with any other software using ActivityPub. This is what Mastodon is, but as you’ll hear, it’s not the only software; there’s many flavours of ActivityPub which can all communicate with one another, and this ecosystem is broadly called the Fediverse.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alex talks about why he decided to delete many of his old social media accounts in favour of open solutions, and how he’s using plugins and his own coding skills to make it possible for cross posting of posts and comments between Mastodon and his WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a really interesting conversation about the recent surge in popularity of these distributed social networks and how WordPress can become a first class citizen in your digital life; so much more than just a website.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.w3.org/TR/activitypub/\">ActivityPub protocol</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://joinmastodon.org/\">Mastodon</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://pixelfed.org/\">Pixelfed</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://joinpeertube.org/\">PeerTube</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/\">ActivityPub WordPress plugin</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/share-on-mastodon/\">Share on Mastodon WordPress plugin</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alex&#8217;s <a href=\"https://casualweirdness.life/\">Casual Weirdness website</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alex&#8217;s <a href=\"https://alexstandiford.com/\">personal website</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 17 May 2023 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:87:\"HeroPress: Exploring the Essence of Community – Explorando la esencia de la comunidad\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:56:\"https://heropress.com/?post_type=heropress-essays&p=5535\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:142:\"https://heropress.com/essays/exploring-the-essence-of-community/#utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=exploring-the-essence-of-community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19351:\"<img width=\"1024\" height=\"512\" src=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/051623-min.jpg\" class=\"attachment-large size-large wp-post-image\" alt=\"Pullquote: This journey through WordPress continues to grow, making me stronger and filling my heart with joy. - En definitiva, mi viaje en WordPress sigue en constante evolución, haciéndome cada vez más fuerte y llenando mi corazón de alegría.\" /><p><a href=\"https://heropress.com/feed/#espanol\">Este ensayo también está disponible en español.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi, I&#8217;m Ericka Barboza, I&#8217;m a computer engineer, I was born in Costa Rica and it&#8217;s been my home since always. I love nature, plants and bird watching. I enjoy hiking and love going to the beach.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I look back and realize that 7 years have passed since I started this journey with WordPress and its community. I realize that time is fleeting.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading_4ec00a-62 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><strong>How I found the WordPress Community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I discovered WordPress in 2006, when I was working as a Web Developer for a digital production services company in Costa Rica. At that time, I created my first blog and as part of my job I had to make modifications to websites made with WordPress. I found it very easy to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, life took me in a different direction and I followed another career path. I started working in other companies, I worked for a bank and a consulting company, both jobs were not related to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2014, I made the decision to become a freelance worker as a web developer in the area of web development and design. I have always been passionate about this field, so I decided to leave my stable job to follow my dream. I wanted to have a better quality of life and more free time to enjoy the days, away from the four walls of an office.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In that same year, I started working on projects in Drupal, which is another CMS. I also got to know this lovely community and began participating as a volunteer in Drupal Camps. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>I loved the idea of belonging to a community of people with common interests and a desire to help others.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2016, I heard that the first WordCamp San Jose Costa Rica was going to be held. So, I approached the group of organizers to offer my help. I felt that I had the experience to contribute to the organization of the event because I had already participated as a volunteer in Drupal Camps, and I thought it was a great idea to collaborate with this amazing community as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s how my journey in the WordPress Community began. I have been an organizer of 4 WordCamps in my country, Costa Rica (2016-2017-2018-2019) in different roles, including Lead Organizer in 2018. And this year, 2023, I joined the organizing team again and I am very excited about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being an organizer of a WordCamp was one of the most beautiful experiences I have ever had. It&#8217;s a job where you not only volunteer your time to make sure everything goes well, also you put all your heart into the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Once I joined the WordPress Community, there was no turning back. I became more and more involved, and as I learned more, I realized that I wanted to know even more. Being a volunteer in this beautiful community has been one of the best things that has happened to me in my professional journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading_9f961b-2e wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><strong>What I love most about WordPress – Community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I always tell people that what I love the most about WordPress is its community. From day one, I have found friendly and helpful people who are always willing to share their knowledge and experience. Being part of this community has allowed me to learn new things and tips, and I feel a great sense of belonging to a group of like-minded people with common interests and goals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since 2016, I have not only been an organizer, but also an enthusiastic volunteer in the WordPress Community. As a result, I have had the privilege of volunteering at some international WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>I have to admit, one of my favorite things about WordCamps is the afterparties.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s that moment when we all come together to network, relax, and even sing karaoke. During the pandemic, I missed the hugs and connections with both old and new friends I made at these events. I am so happy that they are coming back!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2017, I attended my first WordCamp abroad, WordCamp Managua in Nicaragua. I had never been to Nicaragua before and I thought it would be a great opportunity to explore its natural beauty while attending the event. There, I met friendly members of the Nicaragua WordPress Community. I still keep in touch with them and I deeply admire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following year, in 2018, I had a dream of traveling to another WordCamp, but this time even further away from my home country and in a different language. I wanted to experience the global WordPress Community and see for myself how it operated. That&#8217;s why I decided to purchase a ticket and travel to WordCamp Miami 2018. It quickly became one of my favorite camps and holds a special place in my heart.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>WordCamp Miami showed me the other side of the WordPress Community, one that extended far beyond my country&#8217;s borders. </p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>I learned that there were many more people around the world who were doing wonderful work for the community, and that they possessed great talents and expertise to share. There is a whole world out there waiting to be explored.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During WordCamp Miami, I also had the opportunity to meet companies that sponsored the event, and that&#8217;s where I met GreenGeeks Web Hosting. I now work for them as part of the marketing team. Thanks to my job, I have been able to attend many WordCamps around the world, not only as a sponsor, but also as a volunteer and speaker.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am also passionate about being a volunteer at KidsCamp, which is like a camp just for kids that takes place as part of WordCamps. In 2019, I participated as an organizer for the KidsCamp at WordCamp San Jose Costa Rica.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was a wonderful experience seeing all those smiling faces of the kids, and I was able to bring my own nephews to participate, which is something I will never forget and will always treasure in my heart.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before everything fell apart with the pandemic in 2020, I had the opportunity to attend WordCamp Miami 2020 as a KidsCamp volunteer and Team Leader. I loved the opportunity to volunteer in another country and learned so much from the kids. It was the last thing that the WordPress community gave me before entering the pandemic, and I would do it all over again.</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image.png\"><img /></a><em>KidsCamp – WordCamp San Jose Costa Rica 2019</em>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading_a4150f-8f wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><strong>I keep growing with WordPress</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>I am grateful to WordPress and the community for all the professional growth I have acquired in almost 7 years and still counting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My job at GreenGeeks has allowed me to travel to different WordCamps around the world, which has given me the opportunity to meet wonderful people and discover new opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it weren&#8217;t for my active involvement in the community and my attendance at events outside of my country, I wouldn&#8217;t have had the opportunity to know this great company, which also shares the love for WordPress and its community. I am excited to continue growing alongside this community and see what new challenges and opportunities arise in the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the last few years, since 2020, I&#8217;ve been dedicated to running workshops for underrepresented groups in the WordPress community. Together with Jill Binder, Leader of the Diverse Speaker Training group and #WPDiversity, we have run workshops in Latin America specifically for women in the WordPress Community.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>This initiative has been incredibly motivating for me, as my goal is to support more women becoming speakers at WordCamps and becoming visible in the world of WordPress and technology as a whole.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>It drives me even more to reach women in other communities in different countries and languages, and thanks to the translation of documentation into Spanish, we&#8217;ve taken an important step forward. Working alongside Jill on this project has been one of the best things I&#8217;ve found in this wonderful community.</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1.png\"><img /></a><em>WordPress Speaker Workshop for Women Voices in Latin America – Costa Rica 2022</em>\n\n\n\n<p>This journey through WordPress continues to grow, making me stronger and filling my heart with joy.<br /><br />I would like to express my gratitude to Topher for giving me the opportunity to share my story.

Soy Ericka Barboza y soy Ingeniera Informática. Nací en Costa Rica, y este ha sido mi hogar desde siempre. Me apasiona la naturaleza, especialmente las plantas y observar las aves. Disfruto mucho caminar por la montaña y me encanta ir a la playa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cuando miro atrás y caigo en cuenta que han pasado 7 años desde que comencé este viaje por WordPress y su comunidad, me hace consciente de lo fugaz que puede ser el tiempo.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading_4b6b6d-73 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><strong>Cómo encontré a la Comunidad de WordPress</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Descubrí WordPress en el año 2006 cuando trabajaba como Desarrolladora Web para una empresa de servicios de producción digital en Costa Rica, en ese entonces, creé mi primer blog y como parte de mi trabajo tenía que hacer modificaciones a sitios web hechos con WordPress, me pareció muy fácil de usar.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Luego, por cosas de la vida, seguí otro camino profesional y comencé a trabajar como Analista en Sistemas en otras empresas, trabajé para un banco y en una empresa de consultoría, en las cuales ninguna tenía nada ver con WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>En el año 2014, tomé la decisión de convertirme en trabajador independiente como Web Developer en el área de desarrollo y diseño web, siempre me ha apasionado este mundo, por lo que decidí dejar mi empleo estable para seguir mi sueño. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Quería tener una mejor calidad de vida y más tiempo libre para disfrutar de los días, lejos de las cuatro paredes de una oficina.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>En ese mismo año, comencé a realizar proyectos en Drupal, otro CMS. Tuve la oportunidad de conocer su bonita comunidad. Comencé a participar en los Drupal Camp como voluntaria y me gustó mucho la idea de pertenecer a una comunidad con personas con intereses en común y deseos de ayudar a los demás.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Para el año 2016, escuché que se iba a realizar el WordCamp San Jose Costa Rica por primera vez, y fue donde me acerqué al grupo de organizadores para ofrecerles mi ayuda, sentía que tenía la experiencia para contribuir con la organización del evento porque ya había participado como voluntaria en los Drupal Camp, y pensé que era muy buena idea también colaborar con esta gran comunidad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fue así como comenzó mi viaje por la comunidad de WordPress. He sido organizadora de 4 WordCamps en mi país Costa Rica (2016-2017-2018-2019) en distintos roles, en el año 2018 como Lead Organizer. Y este año, 2023, me volví a unir al equipo de organización y estoy muy emocionada.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Ser organizadora de un WordCamp, ha sido una de las experiencias más bonitas que he vivido, es un trabajo en el cual no solo pones tu tiempo de forma voluntaria para que todo salga de maravilla, sino que también le pones todo tu corazón hacia la comunidad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Una vez que entré a la comunidad de WordPress, ya no pude dar vuelta atrás, cada vez me involucraba más, estaba enamorada y entre más conocía me daba cuenta que quería saber más. Ser voluntaria en esta bella comunidad ha sido una de las mejores cosas que me ha pasado en mi camino profesional.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading_ca697c-7d wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><strong>Lo que más amo de WordPress – Comunidad</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Todo el tiempo le digo a las personas que lo que más me gusta de WordPress, es su comunidad, siempre encuentras personas amigables con deseos de ayudarte, aprendes cosas nuevas y tips del mundo de WordPress, me encanta el significado de comunidad, el sentido de pertenencia a un grupo con intereses y propósitos en común.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Desde el año 2016, además de ser organizadora siempre he amado contribuir como voluntaria y es por eso que también he tenido el privilegio de ser voluntaria en varios WordCamp internacionales.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Debo confesar que también me gustan mucho los afterparty de los WordCamp, ese momento donde todos hacemos networking, nos relajamos y hasta cantamos Karaoke, esa es una de las partes que más extrañaba con la pandemia, los abrazos, la conexión con los viejos y los nuevos amigos que haces en estos eventos, ¡me alegra mucho que regresarán!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Mi primer WordCamp en el exterior fue el WordCamp Managua 2017, que se realizó en Nicaragua, nunca había estado en Nicaragua, a pesar de ser nuestro país vecino, así que me dije, porque no ir y conocer de paso ese país con su gran belleza natural.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Conocí a amigables personas de la comunidad de WordPress Nicaragua, con los cuales conservo la comunicación y a los cuales les tengo también mucha admiración.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>En el año 2018, mi sueño era poder viajar a otro WordCamp pero más lejos todavía de mi país y en otro idioma, quería vivir esa experiencia, quería ver cómo era la comunidad global de WordPress, y por eso decidí comprar mi boleto e ir rumbo al WordCamp Miami 2018.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Sin duda, WordCamp Miami es por mucho de mis camps preferidos y al cual le tengo un cariño muy especial, porque fue el camp que me mostró la otra cara de la comunidad de WordPress, la de saber que esa comunidad no solo existe en mi país, sino que hay muchas más personas alrededor del mundo que hacen un trabajo maravilloso por la comunidad, esas personas con gran talento y capacidad para transmitir mucho de su conocimiento, hay todo un mundo allá fuera esperando ser explorado.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>En ese camp, también tuve la oportunidad de conocer a empresas que patrocinaban el &nbsp; evento y fue ahí donde conocí a GreenGeeks Web Hosting, la empresa para la cual trabajo como parte del equipo de Marketing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gracias a mi trabajo en GreenGeeks he podido asistir a muchos WordCamp alrededor del mundo, no solo como patrocinadora en los eventos, sino también he podido coloborar como voluntaria y expositora también.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Otra de las cosas que me apasiona es ser voluntaria del KidsCamp, que es como un campamento solo para niños que se realiza dentro de los WordCamp. En el 2019 participé como organizadora del KidsCamp en el WordCamp de San José Costa Rica, fue una experiencia maravillosa, ver las caras sonrientes de todos esos niños es algo que te llena el corazón y también pude llevar a mis sobrinos a participar y es algo que nunca olvidaré, lo atesoraré en mi corazón.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>En el año 2020, antes de que todo se derrumbara con la pandemia, tuve la oportunidad de asistir al WordCamp Miami 2020, como voluntaria del KidsCamp, como líder de equipo, amé la oportunidad de ser voluntaria en otro país, aprendí muchísimo de los niños y lo volvería a hacer, fue lo último que me dejó la comunidad antes de entrar en pandemia.</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-2.png\"><img /></a><em>KidsCamp – WordCamp San Jose Costa Rica 2019</em>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"kt-adv-heading_a4b68c-f6 wp-block-kadence-advancedheading\"><strong>Continúo creciendo con WordPress</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Agradezco a WordPress y a la Comunidad por todo el crecimiento profesional y espiritual que he adquirido en estos 7 años y sigo contando.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gracias a WordPress y su comunidad, mi vida profesional y personal ha mejorado significativamente en estos 7 años. Mi trabajo en GreenGeeks me ha permitido viajar a diferentes WordCamps alrededor del mundo, lo que me ha dado la oportunidad de conocer personas maravillosas y descubrir nuevas oportunidades.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Si no hubiera sido por mi participación activa en la comunidad y mi asistencia a eventos fuera de mi país, no habría tenido la oportunidad de conocer esta gran compañía, que también comparte el amor por WordPress y su comunidad. Estoy emocionada por seguir creciendo junto a esta comunidad y ver qué nuevos retos y oportunidades se presentan en el futuro.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>En los últimos años, desde el 2020 en adelante, me he comprometido en la realización de talleres para grupos poco representados en la comunidad de WordPress. Junto con Jill Binder, líder del Grupo de Formación de Oradores Diversos y #WPDiversity.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Hemos llevado a cabo varios talleres en Latinoamérica, específicamente para mujeres de la comunidad de WordPress. Esta iniciativa me ha motivado muchísimo, ya que mi objetivo es apoyar a que más mujeres sean expositoras en los WordCamp y Meetups de la comunidad y que se visibilicen en el mundo de WordPress y la tecnología en general.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Me impulsa aún más poder alcanzar a mujeres en otras comunidades de diferentes países e idiomas, y gracias a la traducción de la documentación a español, hemos dado un paso importante. Trabajar junto a Jill en este proyecto ha sido una de las mejores cosas que he encontrado en esta maravillosa comunidad.</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://heropress.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/image-1.png\"><img /></a>WordPress Speaker Workshop for Women Voices in Latin America – Costa Rica 2022\n\n\n\n<p>En definitiva, mi viaje en WordPress sigue en constante evolución, haciéndome cada vez más fuerte y llenando mi corazón de alegría.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Quiero expresar mi agradecimiento a Topher por brindarme la oportunidad de compartir mi historia, ya que me ha permitido revivir muchos momentos al escribirla.

They highlight the benefits of using OG image templates to create visually appealing and professional content. They also emphasize the need for WordPress professionals to offer variety and customization options to cater to different client needs. Cory and Corey suggest considering pricing models and beta-testing strategies to determine market value and gather feedback. This episode provides valuable insights for WordPress professionals seeking to enhance their services and deliver impactful OG image solutions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Top Takeaways:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Explore OG image templates:</strong> OG (Open Graph) images are essential for social media sharing and branding. WordPress professionals should consider incorporating OG image templates into their projects to enhance their content&#8217;s visual appeal and professionalism. This could involve adding a logo, screenshots, or other relevant images within browser frames or mobile device mockups. Professionals can easily create engaging OG images that align with their clients&#8217; branding and marketing strategies by utilizing templates.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Embrace variety and customization:</strong> With the availability of different OG image templates and design options, WordPress professionals should strive to offer their clients a diverse range of choices. By understanding common patterns and elements used in OG images, professionals can create customized templates that cater to various needs, such as showcasing logos, headlines, taglines, or even incorporating screenshots of website pages. The ability to provide personalized options and adapt to different social media platforms will greatly enhance the value of their services.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Consider pricing and beta testing: </strong>As WordPress professionals develop their OG image solutions, it&#8217;s crucial to think about pricing models and beta testing strategies. Offering a base product with well-defined features and functionality can serve as an entry point for clients. Professionals should assess the market value and determine appropriate pricing that reflects the benefits and customization options provided. Beta testing can be a valuable step to gather feedback, refine the product, and generate initial user testimonials or case studies. These efforts contribute to building credibility and attracting future customers.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-mentioned-in-the-show\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f517.png\" alt=\"🔗\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Mentioned in the show:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://crop.express/\">Crop.Express</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://www.canva.com/\">Canva</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://chat.openai.com/\">Chat GPT</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://slack.com/\">Slack</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-you-can-follow-post-status-and-our-guests-on-twitter\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f426.png\" alt=\"🐦\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> You can follow Post Status and our guests on Twitter:</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul class=\"eplus-wrapper\">\n<li><a href=\"http://twitter.com/coreymaass\">Corey Maass</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/corymiller303\">Cory Miller</a> (CEO, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/post_status\">Post Status</a>)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/lemonadecode\">Olivia Bisset</a> (Intern, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/post_status\">Post Status</a>)</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"eplus-wrapper has-background\">The <strong>Post Status Draft</strong> podcast is geared toward WordPress professionals, with interviews, news, and deep analysis. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f4dd.png\" alt=\"📝\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /><br /><br /><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/category/post-status-podcasts/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Browse our archives</a>, and don’t forget to subscribe via <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">iTunes</a>, <a href=\"https://podcasts.google.com/feed/aHR0cHM6Ly9mZWVkcy5zaW1wbGVjYXN0LmNvbS8ySkU5c2M4UA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Google Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/PostStatus\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">YouTube</a>, <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Stitcher</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress-post-status-draft-podcast.simplecast.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Simplecast</a>, or <a href=\"https://feeds.simplecast.com/2JE9sc8P\">RSS</a>. <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f3a7.png\" alt=\"🎧\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /></p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading eplus-wrapper\" id=\"h-transcript\">Transcript</h2>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Session 13 Corey &amp; Cory Launch a WordPress Product Live</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:00] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> It&#8217;s just so much work. I was like, it doesn&#8217;t have to be&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:06] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> initial stuff. I&#8217;ve been doing this so long, to fine tune some stuff, get your workflow,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:11] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> but it&#8217;s just so much work. I was like, it doesn&#8217;t have, but now I&#8217;m like, I prefer this. Yeah. Yeah. There&#8217;s stuff that I want to be very polished and professional, but then there&#8217;s also turn it on and go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re turning on and go. We&#8217;re on now. Like specifically. I gotta turn my lights on. I just realized&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:34] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Corey&#8217;s doing that. Hey everybody, welcome back. This is session 13, I think. Corey and Corey launched the WordPress product live. We&#8217;ve got some cool updates. We&#8217;ve been working on some stuff and when I say working on some stuff, Corey, you&#8217;ve been like on this huge manic state of getting stuff done and yep,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:00:53] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> I&#8217;m pumped about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I I built a hundred feet of fencing. Yeah I, last [00:01:00] week my client, main clients were outta town for a week, so I was like, all right, I&#8217;m gonna take a couple of days off and. Take advantage of the weather, finally getting nice and so built big, beautiful fences which has prompted the promise of an O M G I M G hackathon where Corey is gonna fly me out to his house and I&#8217;m gonna help him build a fence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it also meant that I was. Hacking at our plug-in new product for a couple of hours every morning and every night. And over the weekend. So yeah, the, I just this morning zipped up. I have a little script that I used to zip all my plug-ins for distribution and uploaded it to a testing website and it broke.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then a couple minutes later it worked. So pretty amazing. Yeah, we&#8217;ve now got a plugin that installs. It&#8217;s[00:02:00] tied into e d D. Oh, good idea. Thank you. Yes. We should stand for this proud moment. But yeah I got as far as incorporating the licensing with e D D. So that&#8217;s now tied into the OMG img.co website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That has a, just a placeholder logo on it. We need to put the signup form coming soon on that website. I keep forgetting. But it&#8217;s got the basics. The plugin itself has the basics of, so you can install it, it takes you to a welcome screen. You add a logo and it creates your first image, which is the logo on the left and the title of the site on the right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like we talked about, in, in a few clicks and in a few seconds you&#8217;ve got at least the most basic OG image and I found what I needed to. If you don&#8217;t have Yost or something else [00:03:00] Installed. Then this will show as the OG image. We need to test that a bit more, but is working on my WordPress installs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I also found the hook for Yost. So if Yost is installed regardless of the OG image you have, Plugged into Yost hours will show if you&#8217;ve selected one. And then, and so that&#8217;s Sitewide. And then we have most of the functionality for host specific images as well. And so right now you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Associated with a post, you can create images and you can set those as a featured image, and that works. What I haven&#8217;t finished yet is setting an individual OG image per post. So if you share your homepage, it&#8217;ll show the sitewide [00:04:00] OG image, but if you share a specific post, it should show the OG image for that post.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if there isn&#8217;t one specified then should show the sitewide one. So we need to test that, but all the functionality is there. And then the only other, I mean there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s a few little bugs and things here and there and we need to do a lot of testing on different browsers and stuff like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the, so the OG image per post is the one big thing missing. And. Yeah. And then I think we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re pretty close. We need better templates, which you&#8217;ve been working on. And yeah, again there&#8217;s, I&#8217;m to the point where the, the framework works. We need to pick a couple of templates and just start messing around with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it&#8217;s the like as we&#8217;re going, oh, we really need this over here. And I&#8217;ll go, oh, it doesn&#8217;t support that yet. Let me quick go at it. We&#8217;ll get into that development loop. But that&#8217;s where we&#8217;re at. We&#8217;re pretty far along.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:59] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> That&#8217;s [00:05:00] awesome to hear. Awesome news. Oh, keep building fences cause.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Focus two, you got your physical outlet and then you got your mental digital outlet. That&#8217;s all great news. I think my biggest question is when do you think by end of day our part like beta client site is post has by end of day our, we should be switched over to our new hosting environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And things should be a lot better for the website that have been lingering.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:34] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Congrats&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:37] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> by tomorrow. It should be ready to available, I should say to install the plugin if you wanted to. Great. Okay, that&#8217;s all good news. And on that note for, to recap for others that haven&#8217;t seen previous episodes, where we&#8217;re at now is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You just heard Corey&#8217;s product update, great progress on what we had talked about [00:06:00] the past couple of weeks, about an easy way to show your website professionally on the web through open graph. So posts being our kind of default list lists. Not just iron out the dev kinks, but also how we want that to look cuz that&#8217;s very important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both of us have interest in design. So on that note, using that post as the test, I started working in Canva. I also, my update to you would be also, as I mentioned in Slack I submitted the design request for the templates posts to start to flush out how we want this to look. I do know we do have the nuts and bolts of what we need for just templates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I still need to do more of that work. But I wanted to show you this. Along that kind of research and work from my side, I found this og [00:07:00] image gallery, og image com. Oh, nice. Yep. Wow. This is what I needed. Yeah. I love some of these things. So I took, and I&#8217;m not a professional designer, I&#8217;m just a hobby designer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. But I was like, this is really inspiring for the general. Default website, business card. So just looking through here there&#8217;s just such good stuff. So I was like riffed on something like this with that, and I&#8217;ll have to get this to our designer. But all of that, just thinking about how to offer a really good template option and what is in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I was like, okay. I got the dimensions like we had talked about and just started like going, okay, what were the business cards? Funny going in Chem Camba. When I put in the ratio, I pulled up a business card template. I was like, that was cool to see some of those. And I just started like riffing something that I could at least.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flesh out my thoughts a little bit to get [00:08:00] back to the designer based on some of these other gallery options. So that&#8217;s what I was working on when I didn&#8217;t realize you were here and I was still working. But just for the general website, the thoughts we had were logo, some treatment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I liked about these images over here is like you have a big title. Yep. A small logo. I like how Mix Panel threw in some kind of graphic that linked what Mix panel. Mix panel is.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:31] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> So the technology we&#8217;re using is still technically a screenshot. And so seeing this version one, 1.1 or whatever so in my mind, the first.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>OG image template that we want is logo on the left, title on the right, dead simple, a background, color, whatever. But there&#8217;s [00:09:00] no reason. And, and as the rabbit hole you started going down on our last call that I poked fun at you for was that you kept moving the logo from the left to the center, left, to the right, to the center.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s we don&#8217;t, the beauty of this is we don&#8217;t have to choose. We can if it, we can, there are two things we can do. One is. I can offer an option that says, do you want the logo on the left or center? The other thing is we can have multi, almost infinite templates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I don&#8217;t think we want to have too many. Templates that are too similar, but, looking at that, that gallery you were just looking at, like a lot of these have, you look at the patterns, right? So you&#8217;ve got a logo top left for a lot of them, or you&#8217;ve, and an image on the right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or you&#8217;ve got a logo top and then a text underneath or the one you were just showing me, which is what made me start, made me interrupt you. The mix panel, right? Is. Again, version [00:10:00] 1.1. I wonder that our best template isn&#8217;t actually going to be we can we could actually take a screenshot of their homepage and then automatically suck it in to a template.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with one click, like we would go take, essentially take a picture of the homepage and then put it in a template. They&#8217;ve uploaded a logo, we have the title, and we&#8217;ve essentially recreated that mix panel template in one go. I hadn&#8217;t thought of that cuz we&#8217;re talk, it&#8217;s the what&#8217;s the movie Inception we&#8217;ve got.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Screenshots of screenshots, but but we can certainly do that. We can say, I hadn&#8217;t thought of this before, like talking about creating a template for each blog post, pulling in the title, pulling in the featured image. We could actually take a screenshot of the blog post and then inject it at, in lieu of a [00:11:00] featured image into.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>An OG image, so you&#8217;ve got an actual picture of the website in that, that mix panel style. That&#8217;s really cool. I hadn&#8217;t thought of that. That&#8217;s&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:13] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> so good. I&#8217;m trying to record some of these as we see &#8217;em. Yeah. So I can direct them. But I know what you&#8217;re doing with them too is you see this and go, okay, that means centered left.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This one is in the middle. There&#8217;s another le you&#8217;re right, top left. Seems like I love that idea though of the screenshot cuz like I was having a hard time with the post status one. Just showing my workflow. I was like, okay, trying to create this, what would I want? And I like the examples where they have some image something there and I was like, oh man, here it, so I found a camera like this little browser&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:53] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> frame.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep. That&#8217;s what I was the, it tickled my brain when you showed me this. I&#8217;m like, go take [00:12:00] a screenshot of the post status homepage at, at these proportions and then drag that in here. And that&#8217;s, in l in lieu of that, fake browser, a placeholder. You could actually have a picture of the website cuz that&#8217;s it, that kind of.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>True. And with a drop shadow. And so it&#8217;s like all of these things we can do, but it&#8217;s also, it&#8217;s that kind of thing that adds a little more legitimacy. It&#8217;s the, just as you brought up, I think last time, the, those generators of, books, book cover, so it or fake software, so it looks like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like when people were writing eBooks or, have downloadable software. There were these templates you&#8217;d upload the cover and it would spit out an image, a 3D generated image that looked like the box that you&#8217;d see on the shelf at Staples. That&#8217;s what we were talking about a couple of weeks ago.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doing similar here, where it&#8217;s okay, either upload a screenshot or we can take a screenshot of the actual blog post. So [00:13:00] you&#8217;re, you&#8217;ve got a picture of the website, it&#8217;s gonna lend this sense of legitimacy even more than, a stylized title or whatever. That&#8217;s really slick. But</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the, I&#8217;m not hearing you. Something happened to your audio. Oh, that screenshot.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:18] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Oh, there we go. Okay. That screenshot thing, I was just trying to make sure I got it down. Yep. Just trying to make sure I had that&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:26] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> vision of what we&#8217;re talking about, but I wonder that we don&#8217;t, either. We basically, we need to start a Pinterest board of all of the great ones we find you&#8217;ve got, you&#8217;ve found this gallery that gives us a head start and I feel like we, at some point, you or we should spend 10 minutes just going through a bunch of them recog, noticing some of these patterns okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>20% of them have a little logo in a screenshot. 20% of [00:14:00] them are, 50 50, 20% of them are logo top title bottom and just call those our first three templates or something like that. Incorporating, like you said, with post status being our testing, ground first, testing ground When the designer comes back with your new template, let&#8217;s make sure that&#8217;s accounted for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then those are like the first four that we go live with. Because that&#8217;ll, again if we&#8217;ve, if we identify these sort of, not 80 20, but 20, 20 20, 20 20, people are gonna wanna do wild, crazy things. And like I said I&#8217;ve built the plugin in a way that people can pretty easily create their own.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re gonna need to be developers, but, Can still, add their own treatments and stuff like that. But if we&#8217;ve covered most of the bases, at least for OG images, then, when we publish, cuz again, EDDs all set up, I&#8217;ve added Stripe and all that kind of stuff. Like, all we&#8217;ve gotta do is [00:15:00] Go live, essentially.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, and obviously we want to do that with actual templates that work and after some testing. But, we&#8217;re pretty close. We just need to offer the, a actual, it&#8217;s like we&#8217;ve worked out the engine, we&#8217;ve worked out the wheels. We just now need the what is it, the. The Civic, the Acura, the, s u v and the truck or whatever, but the underlying stuff is all is, has all worked out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:27] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Love it. Just trying to get, capture this for, got it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, because like up here we talked about doing some of these things, but like pulling in a little screenshot, I think that&#8217;d be really awesome. Okay, so here&#8217;s my big question. I&#8217;m scared to ask. Can this be a fr framed in like a browser button? That browser thing, Nick? Oh, for sure. Wherever it was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:56] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Okay. Yeah. Like things we need to work, all stuff [00:16:00] to work out. But absolutely the easy one is, yep. The easy one is just adding a drop shadow. The one that we just need to find essentially the right yeah, the right size, basically either P and g or there are. Browsers or mobile phones, all done in css, which means they will, stretch, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we could actually take screenshots. There&#8217;s one on your screen. Bottom right? Like that phone yeah, the, on the right. Yep. That one. We could essentially recreate that. Go take a screenshot of your homepage, stick it in a phone. And then take a picture of the og, put, create an OG image out of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s if you are a mobile app or something, like we could do that kind of thing. And then we this totally might be a pipe dream, but we can start looking into actually like. Doing skewing type of stuff, meaning we can like some of those OG [00:17:00] images to make it more dynamic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;ve, instead of just a flat screenshot, they&#8217;ve tilted it on its side. We can start looking into that kind of stuff too. I&#8217;m not, I don&#8217;t know yet if we can do it or not, but it&#8217;s not, it&#8217;s certainly not hard to test it. Let&#8217;s see.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:16] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Just thinking about frames for it like that I think is really cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;d want that on Post stuff. Yep. But just a way to frame it in any way. Yeah. The image that you&#8217;re doing I think is interesting. Okay. So I&#8217;m looking at these templates, like that&#8217;s gonna give me another thought for the post status one. Seeing what they come back. I bet you&#8217;ll get something by tomorrow on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Get that in here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Product. Yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Magazine would be in there. Magazine. Oh&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:49] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> yeah. That&#8217;s one of your clients? Yeah. Yeah, exactly. Okay. [00:18:00]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:01] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah. I really like that because for the screenshot for the post it just shows like this is the blog post and there&#8217;s some rendering of it that goes, when I click through, this is what I&#8217;m gonna get and expect to get.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:15] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s, yeah, I think that&#8217;s, that takes it to a, to another level, like not there. And it&#8217;s there&#8217;s different times and places too. It&#8217;s some, if you share on Facebook, you get, you get the full image like this, right? But if you share on Twitter, it&#8217;s like this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or if you share in Slack, it&#8217;s like this. And so there&#8217;s time we can&#8217;t. I don&#8217;t think we can control which version gets delivered where, but depending on your preferred, if you&#8217;re mostly promoting to Facebook, then having an image that has a lot of detail, meaning a screenshot, totally works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Whereas if you are sharing look, in the you that [00:19:00] wise one, if you scroll down if you&#8217;re sharing somewhere that it always shows up small, you&#8217;re like all we want is the name of our website as big as possible Then, and so essentially we&#8217;re giving you lots of options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The one just kitty Corner down memory. That one? Yeah, there&#8217;s your screenshot right there. So it&#8217;s, a fake browser frame around a screenshot of something. And again at an angle, I know we can do rotate. I&#8217;ve already done rotate him in one of my test templates. So that&#8217;s the, that&#8217;s something we could emulate pretty readily.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this is the</p>\n\n\n\n<p>trap, the loop that I&#8217;m stuck in right, is I&#8217;m. I ha I have a tool and I don&#8217;t, I have a solution, but I don&#8217;t have the problem yet. And so I&#8217;ve just been testing like crazy, all the different neat things we can do. But I haven&#8217;t actually sat down and said, okay, let me try to recreate one of these OG [00:20:00] images with our new system, or let me call this template number one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And here&#8217;s the elements that it needs. So this is great. I think, like you said if you get back the new ones for post status in the next couple of days and we pick a couple of these based on the list you just created, then you know, we&#8217;re good to go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay. Yeah. There&#8217;s&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:24] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> a lot of, yeah. Logo, left image, which is what we got here. Logo, top head logo, smaller headline here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Same.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:38] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m seeing a lot of patterns and so again, I think we just pick a few.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course you have our entire marketing strategy done already, right? Yeah. Me and my&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:50] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> buddy Chap, G P t.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus he&#8217;s at while I have &#8217;em. So when I ask the designer to work on some of those, cuz I&#8217;d probably take a lot of these. And say [00:21:00] do this for post status is our test case. Yep. The podcast is gonna be a little tricky I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cuz you want to host probably, but what if you have two hosts? Yep. What if, and you always have a guest I always have a guest. But we&#8217;ll cross that bridge later on. Okay. Logo only. I like that. Logo is screenshot of homepage. See logo and tagline only.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:30] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> So I, I think you should using that og, that image gallery, like for each of these go take, go find one that&#8217;s close to what you want and just like you did a minute ago. Yeah. Like that slide number five, capture one of each. So that it&#8217;s okay, this is, just one big logo that&#8217;s wise, logo and tagline.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s, one of those other ones. And it&#8217;s if we have all of those [00:22:00] captured here forever then that&#8217;s what we start with. And we, and we have a designer actually figure out the proportions, make it look proper. But then we&#8217;ve, we&#8217;re. Like you said we&#8217;re covering the bases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Can do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. We&#8217;re close. I&#8217;m excited. And I&#8217;ve set up, like I said, I&#8217;ve set up most of the basics we need just to get it out the door. At some point we need to have a conversation about pricing. And a logo, but I&#8217;m very, I&#8217;m excited that we are very close to having something that we can, you can be using on post status.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can ha put on my client websites. And essentially we&#8217;re, we might even maybe in post status Slack let&#8217;s see if we can put together a beta. Beta list, beta testers, 10, 50, a hundred, and roll it out to some people, because with e d.[00:23:00] So for anybody who&#8217;s not familiar, that&#8217;s the shopping cart checkout mechanism that has, that&#8217;s really specifically good for selling software licenses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we can essentially give a, give away a free version of the plugin. And it doesn&#8217;t and anybody we give it to won&#8217;t, can&#8217;t update. As we release updates unless they buy or unless we give them a copy. Cuz in WordPress that&#8217;s really what you&#8217;re selling is access to the next version. Cuz everything is open sourced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But so we, I, it makes it very easy to distribute something like this. Like I have no problem giving away the first version to, generally you, trusted colleagues kind of thing. But if it gets leaked, I don&#8217;t care because, we&#8217;re gonna be cranking out new versions, daily, weekly early on as new features and bugs and stuff like that get un get added, fixed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:00] And it&#8217;s, people will have an early beta, but will want to buy in order to get those updates. Okay. I think in,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:09] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> so I&#8217;ve got pricing logo templates, pricing logo,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:14] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> beta testers. Yeah, that seems like we&#8217;re. We&#8217;re ready for all that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:22] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I wanted going with templates so we could have something to like really inform what we&#8217;re doing. Yep. But after we get the first round, I&#8217;ll submit another request for the logo. Yep. And then pricing. I think we&#8217;ll get a I&#8217;ll for our part, get a better view of it when we get it in action.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Show it going. And then, but I think some of the rough pricing talks we had were right on par. Get something, a base product that does something well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:51] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> Yeah. That helps people look better.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:53] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> And then yeah, when we&#8217;re ready for&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:55] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> beta test, which we&#8217;ll just ask you had a hard stop at [00:25:00] the top of the hour.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let&#8217;s wrap up today. Sorry about being late. No worries. And yeah, we&#8217;ll reconvene soon. I feel like things are starting to speed up. This is great.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:10] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> That&#8217;s awesome. Yeah,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:12] <strong>Corey Maass:</strong> I&#8217;ll&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:25:12] <strong>Cory Miller:</strong> try to keep up with you.</p>\n<p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 16 May 2023 23:15:28 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Cory Miller\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"WPTavern: New Proposal Looks to Retire Older WordPress Default Themes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=145067\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:80:\"https://wptavern.com/new-proposal-looks-to-retire-older-wordpress-default-themes\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4259:\"<p>WordPress is approaching its 20th anniversary, and for the majority of those years, contributors have cranked out a new default theme. Even though the structure and supported features of default themes have drastically changed over the years, contributors are still actively maintaining all 13 of the &#8220;Twenty&#8221; themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A new <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/05/16/proposal-retiring-older-default-themes/\">proposal</a> on WordPress.org recommends winding down active maintenance on older themes and implementing a new system of requirements for retiring them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The level of effort to support 13 themes is not insignificant, especially in the times of the rapidly evolving block editor,&#8221; Bluehost-sponsored core contributor Jonathan Desrosiers said. &#8220;The burden of maintaining these themes has historically fallen on the Core team to ensure they continue to receive any needed updates.&#8221; These tasks include things like ensuring compatibility with newer PHP versions, fixing bugs, updates and deprecations of dependencies, security updates, and much more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Because there are so many, it’s not uncommon for it to take several months before older default themes properly support newer features added in WordPress Core,&#8221; Desrosiers said. &#8220;Additionally, themes created prior to the existence of certain APIs are often unable to fully take advantage of these new features (global styles, block patterns, etc.).&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Desrosiers contends that reducing the support burden on contributors will allow them to focus on ensuring the most modern block-based themes deliver the best experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It also helps clear the path for work on new block theme-focused experiments and initiatives (such as the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2023/03/03/hallway-hangout-community-themes-initiative/\">Community Themes Initiative</a>) attempting to refine the role that themes will have in the block editor era,&#8221; he said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Themes released through the WordPress.org account via the Community Themes Initiative, like the <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-themes-team-releases-stacks-a-community-theme-for-building-slide-decks\">recent Stacks slide deck theme</a>, will be officially supported, adding to the load. These themes, however, have the benefit of working with the Site Editor and all the latest features WordPress offers. When dealing with limited volunteer resources, supporting older default themes doesn&#8217;t have as much upside as spending these efforts the more modern themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress bundles the three most recent default themes in the latest download. This proposal seeks to retire older themes after a minimum of five years of support and when usage falls to less than 1% of all WordPress sites as determined by WordPress.org data. Using this criteria the default themes Twenty Ten through Twenty Sixteen would be retired and only receive security updates. Desrosiers suggests a yearly assessment of usage data to determine which themes would be retired.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The three most recent WordPress default themes would be actively maintained and contributors would continue maintaining the following themes with bug fixes, compatibility updates, and security fixes:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Twenty Seventeen</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Twenty Nineteen</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Twenty Twenty</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>The proposal has multiple benefits, in addition to reducing the number of actively supported themes from 13 to 6, but also has the drawback of affecting an estimated 730,000 users who will no longer receive maintenance on their themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>General reception to the proposal has been positive, as those using very old themes are usually looking for as few changes to their website as possible.

WP Engine patched the vulnerability on May 4, but the Akamai Security Intelligence Group (SIG)  is <a href=\"https://www.akamai.com/blog/security-research/attackers-leverage-sample-exploit-wordpress-plugin\">reporting</a> that attackers began attempting to exploit it within 24 hours of Patchstack&#8217;s publication.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Once exploit vector details are publicly released, scanning and exploitation attempts rapidly increase,&#8221; Akamai Principal Security Researcher Ryan Barnett said. &#8220;It is common for security researchers, hobbyists, and companies searching for their risk profile to examine new vulnerabilities upon release. However, the volume is increasing, and the amount of time between release and said growth is drastically decreasing. The Akamai SIG analyzed XSS attack data and identified <em><strong>attacks starting within 24 hours of the exploit PoC being made public.</strong></em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What is particularly interesting about this is the query itself: The threat actor copied and used the Patchstack sample code from the write-up<strong>.</strong>&#8220;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patchstack&#8217;s security <a href=\"https://patchstack.com/articles/reflected-xss-in-advanced-custom-fields-plugins-affecting-2-million-sites/\">advisory</a> includes a breakdown of the vulnerability, sample payload, and details of the patch. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although the vulnerability, assigned <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-30777\" target=\"_blank\">CVE-2023-30777</a>, was promptly patched, and WP Engine <a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/blog/acf-6-1-6/\">alerted</a> its users the same day, site owners have been slow to update to the latest, patched version of the plugin (6.1.6). Only 31.5% of the plugin&#8217;s user base are running version 6.1+, leaving a significant portion still vulnerable unless they are protected by additional security measures like virtual patches.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Exploitation of this leads to a reflected XSS attack in which a threat actor can inject malicious scripts, redirects, ads, and other forms of URL manipulation into a victim site,&#8221; Barnett said. &#8220;This would, in turn, push those illegitimate scripts to visitors of that affected site. This manipulation is essentially blind to the site owner, making these threats even more dangerous.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Barnett noted that attackers using the sample code from Patchstack indicates these are not sophisticated attempts, but the comprehensive security advisory makes vulnerable sites easy to target.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This highlights that the response time for attackers is rapidly decreasing, increasing the need for vigorous and prompt patch management,&#8221; Barnett said.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 16 May 2023 02:40:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:31;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"Akismet: How ConvertKit is using AI to protect the creator economy from spam\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:45:\"http://akismet455732288.wordpress.com/?p=3452\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50:\"https://akismet.com/blog/convertkit-customerstory/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:16545:\"<div class=\"wp-block-group alignfull is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h4 class=\"wp-block-heading\">TL;DR</h4>\n\n\n\n<p>The stakes are always high when it comes to spam prevention.

It’s widely known as the go-to platform for creators to build an audience, connect with them, and ultimately make a living online.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Problem</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>“It’s me, hi, I’m the problem, it’s me.” &#8211; Spam<br />Spam ruins everything, doesn’t it?<br /><br />Spammers want attention, and the ability to reach a large audience of people quickly and easily. This is why platforms like ConvertKit are a target for spammers. Think about it &#8211; contact forms, email automation, e-commerce &#8211; there are opportunities for spam everywhere.<br /><br />In ConvertKit’s case, the “cost of doing nothing” was far too high. The effects of spam, especially if not properly addressed, would trickle down to nearly every part of their business.</p>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-large is-style-full-width-quote version-2\">\n<p>If we allow form submissions just wide open, what will happen is eventually a bunch of fake subscribers or email addresses will end up in customers accounts.

That was 2005, to be clear. In that time, Akismet has blocked over 500 billion pieces of spam at a staggering 99.99% accuracy rate. How? Akismet gets smarter with each site that’s protected, and its advanced AI has learned from over 100 million sites.<br /><br />It was also built by Automattic, the team behind WordPress, WooCommerce, Tumblr, and many other tools that <strong><span>make the web a better place.</span></strong><br /><br />But accuracy and reliability weren’t the only factors for ConvertKit when looking for a solution. Considering the audience they serve, preserving conversion rates on forms was of utmost importance as well.<br /><br /><strong>Nobody Likes A Captcha<br /></strong>Adding Captchas to their customers’ forms would mean adding friction, and thus lower conversion rates. And that’s not what ConvertKit stands for. They want their creators to have access to forms with the highest conversion rates, while also being free from spam. Compromising one for the other just wasn’t an option.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns is-layout-flex wp-container-16 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/30398-3d.png?w=852&h=1024\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3017\" width=\"385\" height=\"462\" />\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<p>“To click or not to click?”</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/c7a89-mask-group.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-3018\" />\n</div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Romane Dagain, Senior Product Manager, explains, &#8220;What we&#8217;re trying to do is really to have this solution that takes care of all of that. So when you think about it, the creators value conversion here.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>ConvertKit needed a solution that blocked spam without blocking conversions for their customers. Something that intelligently worked behind the scenes and wouldn’t add friction or make for a frustrating user experience.</p>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-large is-style-full-width-quote version-2\">\n<p>”Um…using a Captcha is not ideal.

Romane explains, &#8220;We&#8217;ve got a very wide, wide range of people. We&#8217;ve got people who will be very tech-savvy. You&#8217;ve got people who are just starting. You&#8217;ve got people who have a very small email list, and you have really big stars. So we need to have something that is easy to use for all of them and is safe to do so. And I think for us, adaptability and reputation are very much like a competitive asset.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\">The Results</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>“We don’t worry about spam anymore.”<br />ConvertKit went from &#8220;putting out fires&#8221; left by frequent spam attacks to the peace of mind of a solution that keeps them one step ahead of the spammers. And it was all possible using Akismet&#8217;s advanced AI to intelligently find and filter out spam.</p>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote is-style-large is-style-full-width-quote version-2\">\n<p>”With Akismet, we don’t really have to think about spam prevention, which allows us to work on other things. It allows us to work on delivering better features for our customers that they care about – and that are visible to them. And we’re able to do that because of what Akismet is doing behind the scenes.”</p>\n<cite><strong>John Lunsford,</strong> Senior Engineer at ConvertKit</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignfull has-white-background-color has-background is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-group is-layout-constrained wp-block-group-is-layout-constrained\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Automation</strong><br />The average Akismet customer saves 20 hours per month in time they used to spend manually sifting through user-submitted text. Set it and forget it, as they say.<br /><br />Jon says, “We moved from a place of putting out fires to now things are automated. We&#8217;re tracking stuff, we&#8217;re alerting on stuff. So now we know across our whole surface area if we have bot attacks. &#8220;<br /></p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://akismet455732288.files.wordpress.com/2023/02/65d6e-frame-2596.png?w=1024&h=519\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2959\" />\n\n\n\n<p> </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The ConvertKit Package</strong><br />By far the biggest benefit Akismet has brought to ConvertKit is embedded into their product offering. They want to provide a platform where anyone can easily make a living online, and adding Akismet has allowed them to provide just that.<br /><br />Romane explains, &#8220;We&#8217;ve gotten to a place now where we&#8217;re really proud of where we stand and we&#8217;re trying to maintain that. So I think Akismet is now part of essentially just &#8216;The Convert Kit package&#8217;, it just comes with the idea that it&#8217;s safe to use. Our customers know we look after you, we take care of this stuff. You don&#8217;t even have to think about it. All you have to think about is write your content, send your emails, we&#8217;ll get it delivered and we&#8217;ll make sure it gets delivered to the right people.&#8221;<br /><br /><strong>“We Just Do This For You”</strong><br />If only every company looked after its customer base the way that ConvertKit does, there&#8217;d be a lot more happy customers. They needed to protect their customers from spam, but in a way that didn&#8217;t disrupt what their customers are trying to build for themselves. And by adding Akismet, ConvertKit now has a product offering that allows creators to build, engage, and make a living online &#8211; without ever seeing any downstream effects from spam. ConvertKit is protected by Akismet, and so are their customers.<br /><br />Jon puts it best, “From ConvertKit’s perspective, we&#8217;re able to confidently tell our customers by default, like, ‘we just do this for you’. There&#8217;s no additional cost. There&#8217;s nothing that you need to do. Just by default, there’s spam prevention going on in your forms.”<br /></p>\n</div></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group alignfull is-style-aks-enterprise-plan version-2-2 has-background is-layout-flow wp-block-group-is-layout-flow\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns alignwide is-style-aks-enterprise-plan_image_container is-layout-flex wp-container-25 wp-block-columns-is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-style-aks-enterprise-plan_image_container_left_content is-layout-flow wp-block-column-is-layout-flow\">\n<p class=\"large-text-3\">Curious about pricing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"is-style-aks-enterprise-plan_image_container_left_content_short_desc\">Whether you need spam protection for large networks, multisite installations, or something more custom, our team of experts is happy to help.

In April 2023, Vongries <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/kirki-plugin-up-for-sale-development-discontinued\">announced he was sunsetting the product</a> and discontinuing development. He put the plugin up for sale for $30K and sold it for just under the asking price.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I met the Themeum team at WordCamp Europe in 2019 and have fond memories of our encounter,&#8221; Vongries said. &#8220;They reached out to me immediately after the blog post was published on the Tavern, where I expressed my search for a new home for Kirki.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Themeum is a major player in the WordPress world and I truly believe they&#8217;ll be a fantastic fit for Kirki. They have the resources to take the plugin to the next level and give it the attention it deserves.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rayhan Arif, Assistant Vice President of Business Development at Themeum, is expecting the Kirki plugin to come under <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/themeum/\" target=\"_blank\">the profile of Themeum on WordPress org</a> shortly. Themeum is the company behind <a href=\"https://www.themeum.com/product/tutor-lms/\">Tutor LMS</a>, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/qubely/\">Qubely &#8211; Advanced Gutenberg Blocks</a>, and nearly a dozen other smaller plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Since 2012, we have been deeply involved in creating a similar product on another platform,&#8221; Arif said. &#8220;Our past experiences have equipped us with the necessary skills and knowledge that we believe will greatly enhance the value of this plugin. With this improvement, developers will find it easier to add customization options to their WordPress themes. In a sense, this feels like a homecoming product for us.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vongries reported that support on the plugin was &#8220;basically zero,&#8221; despite there being more than 600,000 active installs. This makes sense as it is a framework geared towards developers. The majority of the plugin&#8217;s users have installed the free version from WordPress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There are only a hand full of Kirki PRO customers,&#8221; Vongries said, although some had grown <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/kirki-plugin-up-for-sale-development-discontinued#comment-438934\">unhappy with Kirki&#8217;s lack of development</a> before the acquisition.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Themeum does not have any block-based theme products at this time, so this Customizer-dependent plugin fits in with the company&#8217;s catalog.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Our initial focus will be on enhancing the plugin, after which we will undoubtedly proceed with integrating it into our themes,&#8221; Arif said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We are considering making certain adjustments to our pricing or business model, all with the intention of benefiting both existing and future customers. For example, we might substantially decrease the price.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Existing users may be concerned about the product changing hands, but Arif said it&#8217;s unlikely they will experience significant changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The acquisition is unlikely to bring about any negative implications for users,&#8221; he said. &#8220;The only perceptible change will be that product maintenance will now be handled by a professional team, well-versed in technology and carrying a wealth of experience.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 13 May 2023 00:48:13 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:40:\"WPTavern: ACF Launches New Annual Survey\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=144955\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"https://wptavern.com/acf-launches-new-annual-survey\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2828:\"<p>WP Engine has launched an <a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/annual-survey/\">annual survey</a> for Advanced Custom Fields (<a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/advanced-custom-fields/\">ACF</a>), one of the plugins it <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wp-engine-acquires-5-plugins-from-delicious-brains\">acquired from Delicious Brains</a> in 2022. ACF reports more than 4.5 million active users, including PRO site installs, and WP Engine Product Manager Iain Poulson reports that the plugin is &#8220;growing in every way since the acquisition.&#8221; ACF has added more users, features, and releases, along with community building efforts like <a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/blog/tag/acf-chat-fridays/\">bi-weekly office hours</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the first time ACF has surveyed its user base about how they are building sites with WordPress and what can be improved. The survey starts with questions about the contexts in which professionals are using ACF and the volume and types of sites they are building. Respondents are asked about how they edit their sites, the type of license they are using, how often the reach for ACF in their toolbox, and which ACF features they use most often (i.e. REST API, ACF Blocks, Options pages, ACF Forms, Post Types Registration, etc.).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The survey is on the lengthier side with an estimated 15 minutes to complete. As ACF is a critical and indispensable part of many WordPress developers&#8217; workflow, helping to shape its future development may be worth the time. WP Engine has also added a few questions that may only be tangentially related to ACF, such as where users are hosting their WordPress sites and what they use for local development. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s our primary method for gathering insights and feedback from the WP community on what they would like to see in ACF,&#8221; WP Engine Product Marketing Manager Rob Stinson said. He also related the importance of previous customer feedback that helped ACF&#8217;s team plan and implement features like registering CPTs and Taxonomies (v6.1).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In the near term, we’re working on bringing a UI to register Options Pages which is a PRO plugin feature, some long requested features like bi-directional relationship fields and improvements to conditional logic rules for taxonomy fields,&#8221; Poulson said. &#8220;We will also be focussing a release on more ACF Blocks features and improvements. The survey won’t likely change those planned features, and the initial results are validating our planned work on ACF Blocks.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/annual-survey/\">survey</a> ends May 19, 2023, and WP Engine plans to publish an aggregated and anonymized version of the results soon after the data is collected.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 12 May 2023 20:38:12 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:35;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:83:\"Post Status: The WP Agency Journey with Bet Hannon of AccessiCart-Post Status Draft\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=149300\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"https://poststatus.com/the-wp-agency-journey-with-bet-hannon-of-accessicart-post-status-draft/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:50834:\"<p><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/planet/feed/#h-transcript\">Transcript</a> ↓</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\">This episode features <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bethannon?lang=en\">Bet Hannon</a>, agency owner of <a href=\"https://accessicart.com/\">AccessiCart</a>, which specializes in accessibility for websites, particularly e-commerce sites. Bet talks with <a href=\"https://twitter.com/corymiller303\">Cory Miller</a> about the significance of accessibility, the agency&#8217;s focus and niche, and tips for starting a business. Bet shares their journey in starting their business and how they became interested in accessibility.

AccessiCart is currently experimenting with productized services for accessibility and remediation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\"><strong>Top Takeaways:</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<ul type=\"video\" class=\"wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio\">\n<li><strong>Embrace Accessibility: </strong>Accessibility is crucial in web design and development. Prioritizing making websites accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, is critical. It&#8217;s important to consider different user personas and their needs and continuously work on improving the accessibility of websites.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Continuously Evolve and Optimize: </strong>The field of e-commerce and web development is constantly evolving. As WordPress professionals, we should be willing to adapt, experiment, and continuously optimize our websites and services. This includes staying informed about new tools, technologies, and strategies for improving user experience, conversion rates, and accessibility. Continuous learning and professional development are key to providing high-quality services and staying competitive in the industry.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>User Experience Optimization:</strong> Accessibility and user experience go hand in hand. We should focus on optimizing the user experience of websites by considering factors like intuitive navigation, clear content presentation, fast loading times, and mobile responsiveness. A seamless and enjoyable user experience leads to better engagement, higher conversions, and increased customer satisfaction.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-columns has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background is-layout-flex wp-container-9\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-column is-layout-flow\">\n<h3 class=\"wp-block-heading\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f64f.png\" alt=\"🙏\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Sponsor: <a href=\"https://poststat.us/a2-hosting\">A2 Hosting</a></h3>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>A2Hosting offers solutions for WordPress and WooCommerce that are both blazing fast and ultra-reliable.

And I&#8217;ve got a long time friend here Bet Hannon. And I&#8217;m gonna let her share a little bit more about what you, uh, do in our world called WordPress bet. But I&#8217;m excited about this interview because bet&#8217;s very active in the WordPress community overall, very passionate about this key subject called accessibility and runs a great agency. So bet. Would you share a little bit about who you are, what your, what your agency does today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:02:06) &#8211; Yep. So our agency is Accessi Cart, and we&#8217;re focused around accessibility, as you mentioned, and in particular, um, trying to do a little nicheing toward, um, e-commerce. Uh, e e-commerce, uh, sites tend to be the most, um, frequently sued around a d a in the United States, and then there are increasing regulations in other places in the world too. So we&#8217;re, um, we&#8217;re trying to do that. It&#8217;s, uh, focus on more high interaction sites, so not necessarily just e-commerce, but membership or, uh, so, you know, um, l m s sites, those kinds of things. Anything that has a checkout form. So that&#8217;s what we work on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:02:45) &#8211; Absolutely. Key one is, um, as we talked here before on the podcast, one is like accessibility is doing the right thing, um, by all people. Uh, but also I think there&#8217;s a, we don&#8217;t need anything past that, but if we did, we&#8217;d say there&#8217;s a huge part of the population that can&#8217;t access websites like a lot of us. And being able to do those things on your website, potentially, if you just need a business reason for a second, it&#8217;s like, that&#8217;s a whole big crowd there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:03:14) &#8211; 25%, 2020 to 25% of all adults around the world need some accommodation. So that includes everybody. I mean, when you, when, when I think when people think about that, they&#8217;re surprised by that number because they don&#8217;t think it, they think it&#8217;s, uh, this very tiny little percentage, right? So, um, but it includes, uh, people who are, uh, blind or have vision impairments, people who have mobility impairments, and not just that they&#8217;re paralyzed, but that maybe they have a palsy and they can&#8217;t quite hit your tiny buttons, um, to things like people who are colorblind, people who have reading disabilities. So when you start e even we work on some things around, um, um, being sure you&#8217;re, um, around anxiety and depression as a kind of a fact, a user, uh, scenario. Because if you&#8217;re sign up or checkout processes super long and complicated, people just give up, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:04:09) &#8211; So when you start optimizing and making things accessible, you can increase your audience by, you know, potentially 25%, which is huge. I mean, most, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s probably the biggest, um, optimization rate that you can get. Uh, you know, conversion rate optimizations and those kinds of things are aiming at, you know, 2% would be awesome, right? Mm-hmm. , you could, that you could really blow it up by 25% would be amazing, right? And people sometimes say, well, people, people who are blind don&#8217;t come to my site. And I was like, you know, , you would be surprised, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:04:45) &#8211; They might be trying but not going because that&#8217;s not ready for &#8217;em. Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:04:49) &#8211; And why wouldn&#8217;t you want that competitive advantage? Right? Exactly. If your side is accessible and your competitors isn&#8217;t, then you get those people, right? So</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:04:58) &#8211; By doing the right thing, you also get that. Yeah, exactly. You have to say, we&#8217;re doing the right thing. Um, and I don&#8217;t know, a business leader or owner, if you said you can increase your market share, there&#8217;s 25% sitting out there, wouldn&#8217;t get, wouldn&#8217;t drool wouldn&#8217;t go, whoa, tell me more. And it&#8217;s sitting right here in plain sight,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:05:14) &#8211; 485 billion in, uh, in million in, um, I&#8217;m sorry, 485 million in, uh, disposable income. Mm-hmm. Right? That you&#8217;re just leaving on the table, right? Yeah. So, I mean, it&#8217;s, that sounds kind of, uh, you know, like you, they&#8217;re, they&#8217;re out there to be sort of, uh,&nbsp; to, but, you know, when you serve, uh, this is the great part about what we get to do as an agency, right? We get to help make online shopping l m s membership sites better for people with disabilities, but then we also get to make that, you know, he help business owners, uh, reach out to those communities more effectively. And, and, um, yeah, yeah, it&#8217;s a win-win all around. That&#8217;s, I love what we do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:05:57) &#8211; And I think just like any other community with particular passions and needs, it&#8217;s gonna talk about that too. So if you&#8217;re, it&#8217;s a way to really stand out and get great raving fans doing the right thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:06:09) &#8211; Yeah, exactly. Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:06:11) &#8211; Okay. So thank you for that. Uh, and let me digress a little bit into accessibility and thinking of it as conversion rate too. And market size is very compelling. I mean, one right thing second that, but tell me, tell me about your team now. Um, what else about you that&#8217;s your focus and what you all do, uh, in WordPress, but</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:06:29) &#8211; Yeah, so we&#8217;re intentionally fairly small. Um, we have, um, three of us full-time, a couple part-time, and then, you know, contractors around the edges for specializations as needed, um, or pulling folks in when we need some extra help. Um, so, um, I really like having us not be super hu I mean, lots of peace that you get to choose as the agency owner, right? You know, uh, you know, there are people that just really wanna grow and scale it and have it be 30 or 40 or 80 people or more, but that&#8217;s not me. Uh, I prefer to work in a smaller group. And so that&#8217;s what we&#8217;re doing. That&#8217;s a piece of why we ended up, um, kind of nicheing around accessibility and e-commerce or, or sites, is that in terms of accessibility work, um, you know, a lot of the contracts, uh, over the last 10 years have gone to, um, higher education or government. And those two folks really want bigger, bigger agencies with a deeper bench to do the fulfillment pieces. And so we don&#8217;t get to be a player for those kind of audiences. Um, and at the same time, you know, we can make a, we can have an outsized impact in terms of folks in their e-commerce work. So,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:07:42) &#8211; Absolutely. So what type of clients does that typically shake out to? Um, what, who do you all work best with?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:07:50) &#8211; Yeah. Um, so we&#8217;re, uh, well it&#8217;s, uh, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s kind of interesting cuz you know, I thought when we went back a bit, when we said, okay, we&#8217;re gonna focus on accessibility, that that was gonna be the, the niche. And then, you know, the further you get, the more you realize, oh, okay, accessibility and e-commerce. And then it&#8217;s like, oh, okay. And now you gotta think more, even more. You can kind of keep refining that a little bit. Um, I would say, um, we still do, um, development and re you know, testing and, and stuff for stuff that&#8217;s not e-commerce, but folks that need to have accessibility. So we&#8217;ve done, um, you know, we&#8217;re finishing up projects now for sites that are, um, you know, large nonprofits that are wanting, needing, wanting, needing to be accessible. Um, we&#8217;re starting a thing, uh, marketing site for a bank, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:08:43) &#8211; So they have to be accessible. Um, so, so we&#8217;re still doing some of that. Um, I, I would say the, the places where we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re, we kind of do a couple different things. And so at different levels, right? So if it&#8217;s a s a relatively smaller e-commerce site in terms of not, well if it&#8217;s, if it&#8217;s too small, they can&#8217;t really afford to probably make this work. But, but if they&#8217;re not, if they don&#8217;t have their own in-house development team, for example, they&#8217;re in WooCommerce, but they&#8217;re comfortable having us go in and do some of those, um, remediations for them working with them, there&#8217;s a level of that work that we do. And then at, at, uh, larger sites or larger merchants that where they are, um, they might be in WooCommerce, but they might also be in Shopify or Magenta, um, the testing that we can do, the auditing and uh, testing for them is on the front end of the site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:09:39) &#8211; So we don&#8217;t have to be experts in Shopify to be able to say to them, you have a problem here. This needs to get fixed. Right? And so we&#8217;re doing that level of consulting back and forth, and I&#8217;ve tried, and I, I, I think maybe we&#8217;re just a little early on it, um, in terms of trying to find, um, working with other agencies to have them just contract us with us for, you know, a bucket of hours where we&#8217;re gonna just, they&#8217;ll just line up some testing pieces for us. I think it&#8217;s more effective when we can work around a particular site and then produce documentation for them, for them to do the fulfillment. So we, um, we, in some of the work that we&#8217;ve done, we&#8217;re averaging like three to five hours of billable label for that agency when they have us do an hour of testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:10:34) &#8211; So as we&#8217;re putting that all together and doing the documentation and handing that off to them to get the approval from the client to do the remediation, you know, that, that, uh, we can have a win-win. Uh, as a, as a part of that, we just haven&#8217;t gotten very much track. And that sounds really good. And agency owners are, are interested, but we just haven&#8217;t gotten much traction yet. And I think it&#8217;s because the client, you know, the, the site owners just haven&#8217;t quite gotten to the point where they&#8217;re feeling the urgency about accessibility. And that may come, there&#8217;s some big changes in the EU coming up in another year or two year and a half or so. And, um, so we&#8217;ll see if that moves us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:11:15) &#8211; Yeah. Whether, um, you want it or not, it&#8217;s coming. And, um, you know, so the need is gonna be pressed. Those that aren&#8217;t up to speed as they should be, are gonna be forced to be up to speed very quickly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:11:29) &#8211; Yeah. You, you&#8217;re going to pay for accessibility one way or another, you know, and the que and the question is, uh, you, you know, e either you get suit or fined or you take it, you know, you, you invest in making accessible mm-hmm. . And the question is, do you wanna do it on your own terms at your own speed or do you wanna be kind of compelled to do it by some external authority? So</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:11:52) &#8211; Well said, . Well, okay. Thank you for all that. So that&#8217;s where you are today. Um, I&#8217;m really curious to know how you got here, you know, how did you get started with one, you know, web, web development, um, WordPress, how your agency grew to where it is today? So can you walk me back there on the journey that you&#8217;ve taken? Yeah. Cuz</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:12:14) &#8211; You&#8217;re a part of that journey. Um, so I had, my first career was in nonprofit management and um, I was doing near the end of that more and more technical things. So we were doing drag and drop websites, we were doing email newsletters, we were doing, um, social media wasn&#8217;t there yet, but we were doing that. So in 2008 at the very beginning of the financial crisis, then my organization terminated my position, just kind of downsized my position. And I kind of stumbled into freelancing a little bit. I had no idea that people would pay you to do, you know, uh, email newsletters and&nbsp; websites and stuff. It just had never occurred to me. I don&#8217;t know why, but it just never had. Um, and I stumbled into doing that and I was, um, I told a friend of mine who&#8217;s an iOS app developer, uh, what I was doing, and he said, oh, you should be doing those work, those sites in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:13:12) &#8211; And I said, I have no idea what you&#8217;re talking about. And um, so we went, uh, he lived in the Bay Area, I lived in Fresno and we went home and the next week we got this like, you know, before you could do Zoom set, we both got on the phone and then we both logged into the backend of his WordPress website. And he walked me through what it was like, and it was sort of like my mind was blown. I was like, oh my gosh, this would be amazing. And so I started building sites for people. Uh, and then as we needed to do more customization, I started doing, um, initially for a few sites, I used, uh, a theme generator called Artist Steer. Maybe people remember that I do, to get, to get the customizations, you had to start learning a little bit of css.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:13:53) &#8211; So I was there, but pretty quickly I found iThemes Builder and um, we went there and the support team at Ithe was awesome in terms of not just telling you how to fix. When I, when you had a question about how to customize something, they would not just tell you how to do it, but they would point you through it, walk you through it in such a way that I was learning. I was like, oh, CS, I see that CSS too. I see what that&#8217;s doing. And, and I started learning more and more and more, um, C s s and H T M L and P H P and uh, and then I, them started offering the, the courses, the classes and, uh, Benjamin Bradley and Nathan Ingram and some of those other folks were doing courses, not just on the technical pieces, but on some of the business stuff as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:14:41) &#8211; And, um, along that way I had picked up, uh, part-time folks to kind of start helping out with things. And, um, we grew, um, yeah, just kind of grew quite a bit cuz we were offering, you know, one of the things I&#8217;d learned in those workshops was, you know, figuring out the mailbox money. I think that was, that was, that was Benjamin the mailbox. Yeah, yeah, the Benjamin and, uh, the mailbox money and figuring out offering managed hosting. And uh, you know, at one time we had grown, we probably were offering managed hosting to about 175 cl um, sites. Um, initially, uh, did that in multi-site cuz that was the only way to manage the, all the updates. And then of course we figured out how to do that and how to spin them all apart with, uh, with backup buddy eventually. And, uh, you know, it was, uh, I had fun learning all of that stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:15:30) &#8211; And, uh, and then, uh, we had a client in, uh, that came to us in about 2016 who is, uh, and they&#8217;re still a client today. They&#8217;re a large agricultural water district in California. So they don&#8217;t give water to consumers. They&#8217;re delivering to farmers and they&#8217;re a part of the, they&#8217;re a kind of a special district or a part of the state of California system. So they became aware in 2016 that they had to become accessible. So we, um, we said, well, let&#8217;s, let&#8217;s call, let, let&#8217;s refer you to somebody. And they said, well, that&#8217;s all fine, but we want you all to be the people that are gonna help us manage this day to day. Which was a huge investment in our team. And we got involved, we got, you know, we had heard a little bit about accessibility, I guess at Word camps and, but not much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:16:18) &#8211; And when we dived in and caught a vision of what, how, how, how broad accessibility is, it&#8217;s not just about making something work for people who are blind, but this whole much broader kind of, um, in being inclusive and the difference that it can make for people in terms of being able to access things and, uh, and almost all of us on the team have somebody in our lives that it would, would benefit from making a website accessible. And it, it was just really this sort of aha moment for us. And we, we kind of began to do more and more and more with, with accessibility. Um, I, I think, uh, we&#8217;ve been spinning down and, and as we did, you know, that all of that managed hosting that we were offering at a very low rate, you know, those folks, um, yeah, we just couldn&#8217;t keep doing that business wise.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:17:17) &#8211; And so, so some of my evolution has really been kind of figuring out, oh, that&#8217;s, I&#8217;m really not making money , you know, I&#8217;m not really, uh, making a living for all of us doing that. And so we began to, I think, uh, three years ago, strategically churn some of those folks in terms of raising our pricing, um, up, um, quite a bit. And, uh, and then began to, especially as our experience level, just sort of went through the roof in terms of what we can do, what we can can offer, um, charge charging more for the work that we do. And, um, feeling like we&#8217;re, um, you know, we&#8217;re still in process. Cuz once you kind of get 170, you know, we&#8217;re down to under a hun around a hundred now I think. But, you know, um, even then, I, I don&#8217;t think all those people will stick with us in the long run, but we have served them well I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:18:11) &#8211; And so, uh, and we&#8217;re sending them, you know, handing them off in ways that are, I think gonna be helpful for them too. It&#8217;s just not a good fit anymore. But, um, yeah, we&#8217;ve been, um, and then I would say we started to do more and more with accessibility and then over the last, um, it was about a year ago we realized, hey, you know, the opportunity we&#8217;re, we&#8217;re missing those government and higher ed opportunities cuz we&#8217;re not big enough and we need to find a way to communicate. Um, we had been using, um, my name in the agency and I began over time, began to realize that was problematic cuz it really didn&#8217;t convey what our focus was and it didn&#8217;t help people. Um, it helped people think that we were small, they thought I was freelancing mm-hmm. . And so kind of a, a confluence of those factors led us to rebrand as Accessi Cartt about a year ago. Um, and it took, you know, doing re it takes a while to do all of that, right? It took, it was not until summer last year that we really kind of got all that together. And, uh, and we&#8217;ve had a great response to that. And that&#8217;s been, yeah, been awesome. So</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:19:21) &#8211; I always enjoy these stories because it&#8217;s very serendipitous. You use the word stumble and I go same, same stumbling. I really did stumble and walk back into WordPress. Um, and thank you for sharing the connection too. I knew you had been an ithe customer, but I didn&#8217;t know at at what depth. And so I appreciate that and that&#8217;s exciting. It&#8217;s fulfilling to know that we had a, we had a help in what you&#8217;re doing. Um, but like how Okay, you know, downsizing from the nonprofit spurred the start of you this great agency that you now run and then a client approaching you about the need for accessibility. And it&#8217;s funny because what I know of you today is a huge champion for accessibility, particularly in WordPress Yeah. For all the things you do. And I don&#8217;t even know all the things you do, but I I know you are a continued to keep the conversation around accessibility within the WordPress community, and it&#8217;s so beneficial to have passionate people, but to see where the start and now you live and breathe it, uh, is really exciting. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:20:25) &#8211; And I&#8217;m not even the most technical person about accessibility on our team. Right? I, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;m, I I I, I, I know conceptually how important it is. I&#8217;m super passionate about it, but, but those like nitty gritty technical details of implementing this thing or that thing, um, are, are really not my wheelhouse. That, which is why we have great people on our team for that sort of stuff, right? Yeah. Um, I can be the, um, more of the, in, in terms of the agency, more of the, the advocate, the out front, the per the cheerleader, the, uh, the lead swinging along, but . But every once in a while I&#8217;ll be somewhere someone will ask this highly technical question and I&#8217;m like, uh, yeah, you I gotta call in. That&#8217;s why you</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:21:06) &#8211; Have a great team. That&#8217;s</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:21:07) &#8211; Exactly right. That&#8217;s exactly right. And I don&#8217;t feel bad about that. It&#8217;s, uh, and, and I&#8217;m super upfront about that because I think, um, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s probably true no matter what your specialization is, right? Mm-hmm.&nbsp; at a certain level. I mean, you have enough commitment and you understand, uh, and you understand what that commitment entails so that you&#8217;re, you don&#8217;t, but you don&#8217;t have to be in the deep down trenches of it so much that you, um, you know what I mean? It&#8217;s kind of like, um, in fact, the more you spend there, the less you&#8217;re spending time on the business. And so we actually continue to have that piece where I wear so many hats where I&#8217;m still, there&#8217;s still some technical things that only I do, only I&#8217;m the one that deals with all the D Ns stuff, right? So that&#8217;s like, so we&#8217;re still, because we&#8217;re still small, we all wear those hats, but figuring out how we can, um, continue to manage that, you know, the growth and those, those projects and pieces mm-hmm.&nbsp; where, um, we still have time for me to work on the business and not just in the business. Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:22:18) &#8211; Exactly. And I think this is such a technical subject too that is always evolving, always to be remiss. And I love the authenticity and openness of, like, I don&#8217;t, that&#8217;s why I have these specialists that know these things, because that&#8217;s one thing I have learned about accessibility is there is so much nuance to it that it is constantly evolving. Like even knowing that there&#8217;s an EU thing coming out in the next year and a half, I mean, there&#8217;s so much new nuance to this, and that&#8217;s why having great agency partners like Access card is key because you&#8217;re managing those details. Your team is keeping up with those things. And I, and I love that. Yeah. I was talking to one of our fellow agency owners that, you know, and the, the, the evolving significance of the website in any organization has really evolved from back in the days we&#8217;re talking about. It was kind of an afterthought, you know? And now it&#8217;s like, especially through pandemic, have seen the value of the website, and then you go, there&#8217;s a, there&#8217;s nuances here that you need to pay attention to, like accessibility. So. Yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:23:24) &#8211; Absolutely. And even then, you know, the more we&#8217;ve gotten involved in doing stuff around e-commerce, there are, you know, I, I think you&#8217;re right. I think, you know, like when we were first starting out, it was really sort of an afterthought digital brochure Yep. For the most part. Yep. Yep. And then folks grasped, uh, and we did a ton of coaching with folks about how to use the blog functionality for all your dated content so that you&#8217;re simple. Like you&#8217;re simplifying some of that management of piece. People did get a bigger idea during the pandemic, but you know, when you start diving into e-commerce, I if, if an e e-commerce or even an l m s site or a big membership site, if they&#8217;re, if they&#8217;re really paying attention and really working on these things, they&#8217;re starting to deal with levels of detail around conversion rate optimizations, and how do you place things on the page to, uh, you know, help help, um, you know, convince the reluctant customer to try your product, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:24:24) &#8211; Or, uh, uh, try a trial membership or whatever those kind of pieces are. But that level, uh, getting down into that level of beginning to think about, it&#8217;s not just throwing stuff up on the page and trusting that people will read this wall of content or what, you know, you have to be thoughtful about how you&#8217;re putting things all together. And I think people are coming partway. I think accessibility will be an increasing part of that for folks, is really figuring out. They, and, and I find as I talk to agency owners and other folks in the WordPress space, the agency folks know it&#8217;s there. They, they, uh, I think in some cases they think their folks have a handle on it, when maybe they have a kind of a, you know, a, a, a very, um, base level understanding. And that&#8217;s okay. But, um, just understand.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:25:19) &#8211; And a lot of folks I think are just scared mm-hmm. , and they don&#8217;t feel like there&#8217;s, um, they, they&#8217;re, they may not, fearful is the right word, but they&#8217;re reluctant to get involved with accessibility until they start hearing from clients that the clients want it. Mm-hmm. , they don&#8217;t feel like, because they feel like it might be just the latest new thing. I get that. Right. And so how do they begin to, you know, is it, is it gonna be really worthwhile to invest some time and energy and people in, um, and I, I&#8217;d say I think this is a little different than some of the other fads that may have come across. And so,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:25:57) &#8211; Well, I wanna switch gears for a moment. Um, we&#8217;ve talked about accessibility, but the work you do with e-commerce and l m s, meaning courses mm-hmm. , the ability to create courses. And curious what you&#8217;re seeing in those two, those the broader e-commerce space. Um, we&#8217;ve talked about the, you know, we, we had the digital brochure days, now it&#8217;s realizing, oh, I can grow my business online and through WordPress, particularly as the best tool that I know of for sure to do all that. But I&#8217;m curious what you&#8217;re seeing, like, it seems like there&#8217;s signals of, like, when you get into L m s, this is a specialized part of the e-commerce broad brand. Um, what are you seeing in, in those, the bigger e-commerce and then the l m s space in regards to clients and how they think and are using websites and e-commerce and l m s to power and grow their organizations?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:26:51) &#8211; Um, well, I think, um, you know, there&#8217;s, there certainly are folks that are doing that. And I think there are folks that a, at least have an inkling that there is more, that they could always be kind of tweaking a little bit more. And one of the, uh, advantages that people are discovering is that there are communities out there of folks where they can connect and learn from one another. So, um, you know, you can get involved in, um, you know, e e-commerce communities, uh, that are maybe some of them even platform agnostic that can begin to talk about, well, what are some of the third party integrations that you might wanna look at? What are the, what are some of the strategies for having your own site and site content, but also doing Amazon or also doing Walmart or other, some of these other platform pieces, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:27:41) &#8211; So, and what are, what are the strategies for pulling those all together? Um, so just kind of finding ways to, uh, you know, and WordPress has always been really great about that sense of community and, and helping one another. And that&#8217;s what post status really is in a way, right? As kind of a, a community of folks where we can kind of bounce ideas off one another, can learn from one another, um, um, get those ideas going. And so I, I think I see, I do see that happening and I see that happening around accessibility. Some as well as just more generally about how do we begin to, um, how do we begin to keep, keep raising the bar a little bit, right? You know, as you start your site and you, you, you get it going and, and there&#8217;s a kind of, there you gotta pay attention to all those really super base level kinds of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:28:30) &#8211; And then when you get, uh, I think a lot, a lot of times people starting out think, oh, I&#8217;ll, I&#8217;ll have it made when I get, you know mm-hmm. , these, this little list of things done. And then, you know, you realize, oh, no, there&#8217;s some more things I need to do, or now I need to tackle this next thing. And that it&#8217;s always gonna be that way. It&#8217;s kind of like, it&#8217;s always gonna be a little bit more that you need to do in terms of optimizing it. And I think business owners are starting to realize that even just about their non eCommerce sites, that, that ideally there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s, you can&#8217;t make it the focus of everything, right. But that it&#8217;s not something, it&#8217;s not, uh, you know, we still work with clients once in a while. Like, I just need a website. And then it&#8217;s just like, when it&#8217;s done, it&#8217;s done, and it&#8217;s gonna sit over there for another five years and then I&#8217;ll come back to it. And that&#8217;s just not the way websites work, um, anymore. For sure. So,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:29:21) &#8211; Yeah. Well, if you&#8217;re only thinking about that, you&#8217;re thinking very small and leaving a lot of opportunity on the table, right? Where you nowadays, if you have a business or organization like a nonprofit, you got to, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s par for the course. But I love that you have background and still work with nonprofits too. Mm-hmm. , I mean, that&#8217;s a different type of e-commerce, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:29:43) &#8211; Oh my gosh, yes. And, um, we just finished and launched a couple weeks ago, uh, a site for, uh,&nbsp; the, uh, and, and when they first came to us, I mean, this is part as an agency under two, it&#8217;s was, uh, uh, one thing that I had learned along the way was like, sometimes you get approached and the, you know, based on the name or the, what the organization does, you think, oh, that&#8217;s a small budget group, , they&#8217;re, they&#8217;re looking for a $500 website, right? Um, so when we were first approached by the, uh, can I, can I say clients? Yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:30:15) &#8211; Absolutely. You</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:30:16) &#8211; Can. When I was first approached by the transgender law sender, I thought, oh yeah, that&#8217;s, that&#8217;s gonna be fairly small. Oh no, they have a $5 million a year budget. I don&#8217;t know, there&#8217;s some funding piece. And they are very sophisticated in all this fundraising that they do, and they&#8217;re using all these different like, enterprise level fundraising tools. And what they, they approached us was about, because they have a significant outreach to people with disabilities, and they had become aware that their own website was not accessible. And so they, uh, pursued actually a pretty, uh, one, one of the larger projects that we&#8217;ve done in terms of, it was, uh, a 13 year old WordPress website and had had dozens and dozens of content creators over the years. And so part of what we did was clean a lot of that up, but do lots of accessibility improvements and things like, you know, we discovered hundreds of PDFs that were not accessible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:31:12) &#8211; And so we came in, you have to take the content out of the pdf, put it on the page, and then say, well, you can download this here, but here&#8217;s the accessible content that&#8217;s on the page surface. Mm-hmm. . And we did, you know, we had multiple, multiple people working on all of that for a long time. But Yeah. And, and made it, uh, you know, I think they were a little afraid, you know, there&#8217;s this stereotype that if it&#8217;s accessible, it&#8217;s ugly. And, uh, you know, we went to , uh, you should look at it cuz we, uh, we created a really stunning, I think our fo not me, uh, not, they don&#8217;t let me near the design tools, but the, the design people created just this amazing site that is, you know, that with a vastly improved accessibility. No site is a hundred percent accessible, but, you know, the improvements here were quite significant. And, and it was nice to work with clients that their, their motivation was not avoiding getting sued. Their motivation was, we have people in our organization who can&#8217;t access this stuff. So, uh, it was great. It was great to work with them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:32:22) &#8211; So let me sidebar a second. You said no side is a hundred percent accessible. Great. Tell me more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:32:29) &#8211; So I think that is also a misconception a lot of times that if we just go to the, you know, the website content accessibility guidelines, if we just make everything according to the guidelines, then we&#8217;re kind of bulletproof and there&#8217;s no such thing, right? Because a lot, first of all, a lot of accessibility is contextual. So it depends on what you&#8217;re trying to do with a particular image, with a particular layout, um, what the flow of the content is. A lot of that contextual stuff is important. Um, so it&#8217;s not like, it&#8217;s not like accessibility stuff is hard and fast rules, right? And so, um, it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s more an art than a science in some, in some ways, right? Hmm. Um, so that&#8217;s one and two accessibility, um, strategies are changing a lot. And you really, I think it&#8217;s more effective to think about accessibility as a form of user experience optimization.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:33:24) &#8211; Mm-hmm. . So you&#8217;re not, you&#8217;re, you&#8217;re really just broadening the user personas and thinking about user experience mm-hmm. . And so it doesn&#8217;t make any sense to say your site is a hundred percent on user experience, something, you know, it, that, that doesn&#8217;t make any sense at all. But you can certainly, I mean, certainly there&#8217;s a lot of low hanging fruit that you&#8217;re gonna do, just like for user experience, right? And in terms of making, improving that. And so rather than talk about, you know, sort of being accessible, you wanna say working on accessibility or improving accessibility, right? And, and, um, it&#8217;s kind of like SEO in that way, right, too, right? Yep. You know, it&#8217;s, there&#8217;s a lot of basic best practices that everybody should do. There are some things definitely you can do that are shooting yourself in the foot with SEO or, or accessibility. But, you know, once you deal with those base level pieces, then it&#8217;s really about continuing to think about that experience to listen to your users when they give you feedback about something that isn&#8217;t accessible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:34:28) &#8211; Oh, that&#8217;s good. Absolutely. From the user experience, if you think about that, that you reset us there, or me, I go absolutely. It&#8217;s another avatar to persona to be thinking about as you want people to come to your site and float through and take an action. Yeah. But</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:34:43) &#8211; It&#8217;s not one, one avatar though. But it&#8217;s</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:34:45) &#8211; Exactly many, many</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:34:47) &#8211; Avatars, right? So the colorblind person, the person mm-hmm.&nbsp; own vision, the person who&#8217;s completely blind, the person who has no, uh, can&#8217;t use a mouse, right? So you get all of these various avatars and there are, I would say, you know, there, there&#8217;s certainly a person who&#8217;s deaf, right? So you get, you get some avatars that are there that you begin to work with, and then, you know, it, it&#8217;s just sort of human nature. We say, oh, we&#8217;ve completely forgot about the person with reading disabilities, right? So now we gotta come back and, uh, begin to think about, uh, did we, did we take that into account? So</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:35:22) &#8211; Here&#8217;s a quick sidebar cuz you mentioned death. And I go, I, in the initial list I was waiting for you to say, um, hearing impaired or, or deaf. And I go, I, I, six years ago got hearing aids and um, it&#8217;s amazing they&#8217;re Bluetooth enabled, but it&#8217;s, yep. This is maybe a nuance off the, off the trail of a second, but they&#8217;re Bluetooth to my phone. Yep. And so I&#8217;ll be looking at the web, and all of a sudden, I can always tell when a site has something, um, like there&#8217;s no audio video on the page necessarily, but my Bluetooth kicks in for my hearing aids. And I go, now this is the skeptical, you know, hat and me going, wh why are they accessing my microphone in some way? It&#8217;s really interesting, but I pay attention to the fact that now I need these, I rely on them every day, you know? Absolutely. And so how important that is to, to me, and I can just see those that I do have hearing without hearing aids, however significantly enhance with hearing aids, like I can actually, I don&#8217;t know, function. Um Yep. It, it brings that more empathetic to me to know, oh, can I, could you even imagine someone with ocular, for instance, implants and like that the, the need for ex accessibility just kind of even becomes more aware to me. Yep,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:36:42) &#8211; Yep. And you know, the, the, the number of people that bring disabilities with them as their, their users increases with age. Right? We all right? Yep. Uh, things, things like hearing like you and, you know, I got hearing aids within the last year too, and so, uh, congrats. But also thank you. Um, also things like color perception changes as you age, right? Mm-hmm. , so, so some of those as the lens of your eye yellows, right? So, uh, there&#8217;s kind of a, a biological piece, right? But, but it&#8217;s also, you know, any of us, any of us are just one illness or accident away from a disability, right? And so, um, there&#8217;s, there&#8217;s that piece of, you know, making it, uh, thinking about including accessibility that kind of sensitizes you to that. But when you think about you&#8217;re improving, you&#8217;re improving the user experience of people with disabilities, when you do that, you actually improve the user experience for everybody. And so I usually say it&#8217;s kind of like those curb cuts in the sidewalk, right? They&#8217;re made for wheelchairs, but like, when I&#8217;m dragging my luggage, I&#8217;m really grateful for those, right? So, yep. Uh, it&#8217;s, all of those kinds of improvements will help the user experience across the board for everyone. Mm-hmm. .</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:38:00) &#8211; Yeah. You watch</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:38:01) &#8211; Stuff with captions on</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:38:02) &#8211; All the time. I have for probably 10 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:38:06) &#8211; I started doing it, yeah. About 10 years ago when we were watching British crime shows and I couldn&#8217;t understand people&#8217;s accents sometimes. And we watch it with all the time with stuff now. And, um, they say that, um, uh, on social media, people who are watching videos with the sound off of those people, 80% of them have no hearing impairment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:38:33) &#8211; I, so, well, I obviously needed hearing aids, but I did it because I read much faster than I can follow. Absolutely. This, in fact, zoom has the feature with ca closed captioning. Sometimes if it&#8217;s a heavier accent, I&#8217;ll do it there too, but I&#8217;m like, I find myself going, I&#8217;m not watching, I&#8217;m reading , you know, so often that that&#8217;s how I get the story. But yeah. And I don&#8217;t like to have my volume on social media, so I&#8217;m really glad that accessibility is a thing, um, because I&#8217;m like, I don&#8217;t wanna listen to it. I wanna read it, you know? Yep, yep. Um, I actually get offput sometimes when everything is video. Cause I go, even though I&#8217;m doing video now, it&#8217;s because I wanna read read the Captains. So,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:39:15) &#8211; Yeah. But you know, there&#8217;s, um, if you put the, like if people are doing a piece like this and then you can get it, there are services to get it automatically converted to a transcript mm-hmm. , but when you provide the transcript in addition to the closed captions, right? If you provide the transcript, then I can remember, oh, Corey and I talked about this one thing, and I&#8217;m gonna go back to that. Now I can search through the transcript Yeah. And find it and not have to listen to the whole thing. People do that a lot. People tell us all the time that they do that. So</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:39:43) &#8211; I do, I&#8217;m glad YouTube now has that part of it, um, because I wanna get the content, but I wanna scan down and read. And sometimes I&#8217;ll play it and just watch the transcript scroll, you know, so, and then we do transcripts, everything we do here, um, yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:39:57) &#8211; Yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:39:58) &#8211; Probably one for my own, like, I, I like to do that, but also to make him available in different formats, so yeah. Awesome. Well bet. Thank you for this. Um, what, uh, I&#8217;m curious, what exciting things do you have going now? What are you doing that you&#8217;re excited about? Um, next steps, anything you&#8217;re focusing on that you wanna share with our audience?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:40:20) &#8211; Yeah, I&#8217;m, I&#8217;ve, I&#8217;ve been trying to, to, you know, part of, part of uh, part of running an agency is being a bit of an entrepreneur, right? And you&#8217;re always tr uh, at least for me, I&#8217;m always trying things and pu focusing on things or just, you know, trying experiments. Sometimes they&#8217;re just thought experiments and sometimes, you know, you&#8217;re actually kind of build &#8217;em out a little bit and see if they stick. It&#8217;s kinda like, you know, throw throwing the proverbial pasta against the wall to see if it sticks. So I&#8217;ve been playing with, um, would having productized services be an interesting thing for accessibility and remediation? So I&#8217;ve cut it out there. I&#8217;m kind of trying to, you know, talking with people who do these things or, and they look at what we&#8217;ve got up there and oh, it&#8217;s a little confusing. How do you pick a package? Oh, okay. Yeah. So figuring out some of those, so that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m playing with right now is kind of like, um, does that really make sense? It makes more sense for a site owner. Um, maybe not it for an agency, but um, although they could contract it out I suppose. But yeah, just trying to sort through that and play a little bit more with some productized services around accessibility and remediation, auditing and remediation stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:41:35) &#8211; Yeah. That&#8217;s awesome. Well bet. Tell us where we can find more about yourself and your agency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:41:42) &#8211; Yeah, so our website is accessi cart.com and uh, you can contact me there. I&#8217;m still on Twitter some, although it just feels a more and more like a ghost town there. Um, and we&#8217;re on LinkedIn, of course, uh, excessive cart and then also Bet Hannon. So love to, and I&#8217;m in the slack for post status, so that&#8217;s a great place to reach me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cory Miller (00:42:04) &#8211; Fantastic bet, Hannon, thanks so much for sharing your journey and what your agency is doing in our world, particularly with the e-commerce and accessibility. Keep doing what you&#8217;re doing. But thank you for being on today for post status draft.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bet Hannon (00:42:18) &#8211; Thank you, Ebra fun.

It was given a 9.8 (Critical severity) CVSS 3.1 score and is not yet known to have been exploited.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Muhammad outlined the vulnerability in a <a href=\"https://patchstack.com/articles/critical-privilege-escalation-in-essential-addons-for-elementor-plugin-affecting-1-million-sites/\">security advisory</a> published today:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>This plugin suffers from an unauthenticated privilege escalation vulnerability and allows any unauthenticated user to escalate their privilege to that of any user on the WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is possible to reset the password of any user as long as we know their username thus being able to reset the password of the administrator and login on their account. This vulnerability occurs because this password reset function does not validate a password reset key and instead directly changes the password of the given user.&nbsp;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The plugin&#8217;s authors published the patch today, on May 11, with the following note in the changelog:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>5.7.2 – 11/05/2023<br />Improved: EA Login/Register Form for Security Enhancement<br />Few minor bug fixes &amp; improvements</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The vulnerability affects sites using versions 5.4.0 to 5.7.1 of Essential Addons for Elementor.

If financial considerations are preventing anyone from applying, there are scholarships and grants available to help cover travel expenses. WCUS is now accepting applications for the <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2023/apply-now-for-the-kim-parsell-memorial-scholarship/\">Kim Parsell Memorial Scholarship</a> for travel. This particular scholarship applies to anyone who is a WordPress contributor, identifies as a women, has never attended WCUS, and requires financial assistance to attend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the interest of promoting a more diverse pool of speakers, MasterWP has launched its travel grant program for WCUS that will support a larger number of applicants. The program will provide more than $10,000 in grants for members of underrepresented groups who are accepted to speak at the event. Those who are selected will receive at least $1,000 towards their travel expenses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022, the program paid for seven speakers and organizers from underrepresented groups attending WCUS in San Diego. This year MasterWP is aiming to support more speakers and has already received contributions from AccessiCart, Nexcess, Paid Memberships Pro, The WP Minute, and UnlimitedWP towards the fund. They are still <a href=\"https://masterwp.com/travel-grants-for-wordcamp-us-2023/#companies\">accepting corporate grant partners</a> and 100% of funds contributed go directly to the grant recipients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In recent years, flagship WordCamps have stepped up their work towards diversifying their speaker lineups, as the community has held organizers&#8217; feet to the fire when events failed to recruit a diverse selection.  WordCamp Europe has come under scrutiny once again this year for its response to <a href=\"https://twitter.com/michelleames/status/1655970579248193536\">criticism about the lack of diversity</a> in its early speaker announcements. The event has a <a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2023/speaker-support-program/\">speaker support program</a> that connects speakers to companies for financial support but is not involved in the selection process.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">So far only 25% of the speakers announced for <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/WCEU?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#WCEU</a> are women (by name/photo), and only three appear to be non-white.

Inclusion is the future. Without it we are irrelevant.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>MasterWP&#8217;s travel grant program was created as an independent initiative and is not affiliated with WordCamp or The WordPress Foundation. A growing dissatisfaction with speaker diversity at WordCamps has led WordPress companies to create their own means of supporting the diversity they hope to see at events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;My conversations with leaders at several major companies led me to believe that many well-meaning, friendly and progressive people simply do not understand that some people cannot afford to participate in the career-growth opportunity of attending a major WordCamp – a similar dynamic to <a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://news.climate.columbia.edu/2022/03/21/unpaid-internships-are-unethical-and-wrong/\" target=\"_blank\">the unfairness of unpaid internships</a>,&#8221; MasterWP publisher Rob Howard said in a <a href=\"https://masterwp.com/our-wordcamp-travel-program-stats-recap-and-the-future/\">recap of the 2022 program</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Since diversity is fundamentally an economic issue, improving it requires economic change.

My name is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case launching a plugin into an already competitive market.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice. Or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m very keen to hear from you, and hopefully you get you or your idea featured on the show. Head to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today we have Mark Westguard. Mark is an agency owner and developer behind the WS Form plugin. And he&#8217;s on the podcast to chart his journey in the WordPress space, and the different ways he&#8217;s explored to grow the reach of the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First up, we talk about why mark started to use WordPress. As you&#8217;ll hear he already had a successful agency, but he could see that the path to profitability was becoming harder each year. WordPress plugins offered the chance of recurring revenue, which was appealing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users of WordPress will know that there are many form solutions. Both free and paid plugins are available, and can handle almost any scenario you might imagine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We get into what made Mark pick this as an area to invest in. Surely it would have been easier to work on something brand new? Mark does not think so. He could see gaps in the market and built his solution to cater to those. This involved plenty of market research and analysis of where to put his development efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We then move onto the subject of turning a well-developed plugin into a viable business. It&#8217;s one thing to build a product, but if you&#8217;re going to make it commercial, much of the work will revolve around ensuring that the world knows about it. Marketing is a relentless enterprise, and one that you should not ignore or underestimate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This might mean getting yourself out into the community to meet with other WordPressers, appearing on podcasts, or sponsoring WordPress events. There&#8217;s no perfect answer. Just run with what works and try out new things all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that comes support. Mark&#8217;s pretty clear your product will succeed or fail based on how you handle support requests. He thinks that the development of a plugin inevitably leads to support tickets, and this needs to be factored in right from the start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also get into the subject of pricing, and what Mark feels was the right price to pitch his plugin. Is the WordPress ecosystem guilty of expecting a lot from plugins at prices which are realistic? How much of the functionality, if any, should be given away in a free version? And how did he decide which features to charge for?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end of the podcast we stray into the plugins use of AI, and how Mark was an early mover in this area. What can be done with forms and AI, and does he see AI as a technology which is going to grow in the future?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast, where you&#8217;ll find all the other episodes as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so without further delay, I bring you Mark Westguard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Mark Westguard. Hello, Mark.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:34] Mark Westguard: Hey Nathan, how are you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:35] Nathan Wrigley: Very good, thank you. Mark is joining us today. We&#8217;re going to have a chat all about, well, I guess building plugins in what is a competitive marketplace. Marketing, launching, creating, having an idea for what plugin you&#8217;re going to decide to create. But before we do that Mark, I wonder if you wouldn&#8217;t mind spending just a few minutes, give us a potted history of yourself. Who you are. How come you&#8217;ve ended up developing on top of WordPress. All of that good stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:04] Mark Westguard: Yeah. About 26, 27 years ago out of university, I decided I was going to start a web agency. Back when we had to teach companies what the web was. Nowadays everybody knows what the internet is. Back then, we were trying to convince companies that they needed a website. And started an agency. We were quite successful. We were the UK&#8217;s second fastest growing web agency at the time. And went through the whole dot com boom and bust, and have been in the web industry ever since.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And about, I want to say about 14 years ago, I actually got into the licensing game. I was marrying my wife and, I&#8217;m not a US citizen, my wife is. So we had a bit of an international wedding and we needed to RSVP guests from both countries. So I built an RSVP system, and I thought, oh, other people may want to use this. And I actually licensed it and ended up licensing that to a company called Condé Nast, which people may be familiar with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They produced Vanity Fair Magazine and also Brides Magazine. I White labeled it to them. And that was kind of my entry into the licensing world. And that company went on for about six, seven years. I had that company for about six, seven years. And then I got back into the web agency game again, and that&#8217;s when I started using WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that was around about, I want to say, probably about 10 years ago now. We were back in the agency game, building websites and sat down one day with my wife and I said, look, I&#8217;m building all these wonderful things for people, great websites, but also software development and apps and things like that. And decided I want to get back into the licensing game and building a plugin seemed to be a good way of doing that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And sat down with my team at the time and said, look, what do you not like about WordPress? What is, you know, a challenge for you when we&#8217;re building websites. And forms came up, and we thought, okay, let&#8217;s try and tackle the form problem. And that&#8217;s basically what started WS Form, and where I am now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So really it came from a lot of experience in the web industry, just trying to tackle an issue that we come across personally as a company and wanted to improve on. And that&#8217;s where WS Form was born.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:15] Nathan Wrigley: Do you have a relationship with WordPress going back years and years? Or in your case, did you pick WordPress because you knew you wanted to create some sort of solution that you could sell into the market, and WordPress at the time was the dominant force, so that&#8217;s where you ended up? Or have you been building websites with it for many, many years?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:34] Mark Westguard: We had been building websites with it, yeah, for quite a long time. I was not the one that introduced my company to it. It was actually one of my employees who went to a WordCamp. Really liked the WordPress product, was very keen about it. It took me, I&#8217;ll be honest, it took me a while to warm up to it because we were originally building websites from scratch. Literally from scratch, and building the admin things for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the idea of having a pre-built content management system was quite new to me at the time. So, it&#8217;s something that we&#8217;ve been using for at least 10 years. We&#8217;re not by any means like some other companies that have been there for the full 20 years. But yeah, 10 years of building websites, and then more recently getting very much more involved in the community and building plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:17] Nathan Wrigley: So the desire was to build a plugin, to sell something into the marketplace, give away a free version as well. And you&#8217;re casting around and you&#8217;re thinking, okay, what thing could we build?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:29] Mark Westguard: Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:29] Nathan Wrigley: Why forms? Of all the things it feels that in the last 10 years even, or more, there have been some incumbent players. I mean, some players have come, some players have gone. But there&#8217;s been some solid competition, some rivals in that space. What on earth were you thinking there? Launching into a marketplace which you could have already described as possibly saturated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:08:54] Mark Westguard: Partially madness I think. I think that we saw a genuine gap in the market there. There were some frustrations that we had and that other people had as well. You&#8217;re right, it was a very saturated area. It&#8217;s a very well established part of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every website needs a form. We don&#8217;t particularly like building them. Without a form, you&#8217;re not going to get any feedback from your customers or from potential customers or whoever&#8217;s using your website. We saw that there were better ways that we could do certain things that were lacking in some of these form plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, mobile responsiveness, actually being able to build a fully responsive form with break points. We weren&#8217;t very happy with the number of plugins you had to add to get a form plugin to do what we wanted it to do. There were performance issues. There were styling issues. So all these things were things that we could improve upon. And so we embarked on that journey.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We thought it was going to take, five, six months and four years later we&#8217;re still here building more and more for it. So it&#8217;s certainly been a big challenge. So basically we just saw a genuine need there and thought we&#8217;d go ahead and tackle it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:03] Nathan Wrigley: I wonder if you&#8217;d, if you had done any market research in the WordPress space, aside from forms? You know, whether you&#8217;d thought about building, oh, I don&#8217;t know, a page builder or a caching plugin. You know, all these other things where there&#8217;s lots of scope, there&#8217;s a lot of ways to differentiate yourself and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the question really is, what kind of market research did you do inside the WordPress space, if any, to figure actually forms is it? You mentioned that you found a need and you described all of the different things that you felt were lacking. I wondered if you&#8217;d ruled out other types of plugins?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:36] Mark Westguard: We did, we looked at other plugins in the space that we were using as well. I think the thing that attracted me to it personally is probably my programming background and my desire to integrate one thing with the other. Which has been a big part of WS Form. Before I had my agency, I was working for a company called Sequin, who are now owned by IBM and I worked in their communications team, and I worked on networking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we would integrate one machine with another. The challenge of making that integration process easy with WS Form was something that attracted me as well. One very simple example, a lot of form plugins you have to go off, get an API key or set an app up. It was a very long process just to get your website connected to a third party platform. And I saw that a lot of these platforms we&#8217;re now using OAuth, which is a very simple way for users to be able to connect their platform well from one platform to another.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I wanted to incorporate that into WS Form, which is one of the things that we&#8217;ve done. I think it was looking around at where we saw that there was a gap in the market. Granted, a small gap in the market because it was a saturated area. But also just a desire to build something that would interest me as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:46] Nathan Wrigley: I&#8217;m wondering if there were people listening to this podcast who have a desire to get into WordPress plugin development. Let&#8217;s stick with plugins, particularly. I know there&#8217;s a whole range of different marketplaces, themes and so on. But if we just stick with plugins, I wonder what your opinion is of the marketplace. Whether or not the growth of WordPress, which inexorably seems to go up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s the low forties at the moment. I don&#8217;t know where it&#8217;ll be the next time we hear that figure. But it does seem to just sort of keep edging up. So the audience is growing, but equally the number of players getting in, developing plugins, it feels like there&#8217;s not just a plugin for that, but there&#8217;s often multiple plugins for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so speaking to people who are considering this as a career, do you have any pearls of wisdom? Any advice for people in that space? Is WordPress still a land of bounty, or is it more, as you might imagine everywhere else, a story of hard work, trial and error, occasional failure and so on?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:55] Mark Westguard: I think that there are two distinct types of developers in the WordPress space. You&#8217;ve got people that just genuinely just want to build a bit of software that&#8217;s open source, and want to support the community that way. And they&#8217;re not necessarily interested in monetizing it. Those that do want to monetize it, you&#8217;ve really got to run that business like any other bricks and mortar business. Don&#8217;t think that you can just write a plugin, put it in the repo, and suddenly start making huge amounts of money from it, because it just doesn&#8217;t work that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ve really got to market it properly. You&#8217;ve got to be, in my opinion, if you want to be successful in the WordPress space, you&#8217;ve got to be part of the community. And that means giving back. If you want to be successful, but also respected in the industry, you&#8217;ve got to give back in the community and be part of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of other advice I would give would be, and we can talk about this later, but marketing. And different things that I&#8217;ve tried with marketing that have worked and haven&#8217;t worked. It&#8217;s very easy to pump a lot of money into marketing and get nowhere with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve found that the whole WordPress ecosystem is a very different way of marketing. There&#8217;s a lot of established brands there. Be it people like yourself, Nathan, with podcasts. Or people in the hosting industry that they&#8217;ve got a big customer base there and you need to be in with those people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you know, you don&#8217;t just approach them and say, hey, here&#8217;s my product. You&#8217;ve got to build genuine relationships with people. The WordPress community is just a wonderful group of people that all want to help each other and all want to respect each other. And you&#8217;ve got to be part of that. You&#8217;ve got to be respectful and you&#8217;ve got to be friendly and get on with these people and build genuine friendships and relationships with them in order to grow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:14:33] Nathan Wrigley: Let me just rewind a little bit, but I will come back to marketing that we&#8217;ve just mentioned, but you mentioned the community and how you thought being involved in the community was a good way to figure out the path that you want to take, but also to get some, I&#8217;ll use the word credibility in the WordPress space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What do you mean? What things have you done in the community which you feel have either given back, so that&#8217;s in one direction, but also have benefited you, so that&#8217;s other direction. What things have you undertaken? What events have you been to? Things have you sponsored, whatever it may be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:08] Mark Westguard: Yeah, I think in terms of relationships with people, that can certainly help you get exposure of a product. So maybe contributing to a podcast or something. It&#8217;s only small amounts The thing that I&#8217;ve found is there&#8217;s no single channel in the WordPress space where you can say, hey, here&#8217;s my product, and expect thousands of people to learn about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a very distributed community of lots of small channels. And you need to be involved with all those different channels to get a bigger voice. So, yeah, contributing to say podcasts. Just getting people using the product that enjoy using the product and those people can become almost brand advocates naturally because they like using the product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, obviously you&#8217;ve got to have a good product in the first place. And that&#8217;s someone we can talk about. What product do you decide that you want to build in the first place? I think that, going back and then I&#8217;ll come back to your point, is there&#8217;s a lot of plugins out there that can be done better. There&#8217;s plenty of scope out there for improvement. You don&#8217;t have to become the next big thing that no one&#8217;s thought about. So I think that&#8217;s an important thing to consider.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, WordPress has like five for the future, for example. And I know that&#8217;s not very well defined at the moment. They&#8217;re still trying to work out other ways to say, hey, you know, you&#8217;ve done that. We&#8217;d like to recognize that as part of that five for the future. But doing WordCamps is one of the biggest things I spend money on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Primarily it&#8217;s to meet new customers. Demo the product. But it&#8217;s also building genuine relationships at these events, which has been really great for me. So, meeting people in all walks of life form hosting companies to other plugin companies. I&#8217;ve met people at other plugin companies at WordPress events, like WordCamp, and we&#8217;ve built an integration between us and then you&#8217;ve got co-marketing going on there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So anywhere where you can identify a business that has an existing customer base that you could potentially plug into by developing something that will genuinely help those customers is a good way of increasing your of sphere of influence.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s also just doing things like giving back to things like Big Orange Heart, for example. And we&#8217;re also doing something right now with GiveWP where they&#8217;re going to be giving away three websites to three nonprofits. And we try to donate licenses wherever we can to help out with that. That in turn, WS Form will appear on something, and it may only be seen by a handful of people, but the more and more you do of that, the more brand awareness you get.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I&#8217;m about doing that type of community work rather than trying to pump money into Google AdWords or a Facebook ad or you know, an Instagram ad or whatever it may be. Really you are pushing your product in people&#8217;s faces. I find that if people are recommending your product, you&#8217;ve got a much higher conversion rate, and really word of mouth business is the best business you can get.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:04] Nathan Wrigley: You mentioned that you&#8217;ve been in different lines of work in the past, and I don&#8217;t know if in those lines of work you were customer facing. In other words, if you were selling directly into that market. So you may able to answer this question. But, in the round, broadly speaking, how easy or difficult has it been, in your estimation, to get a product to the point where it&#8217;s self sustaining. It justifies itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s no longer a pet project. Something you do at the weekends and in the evenings. It&#8217;s now your actual core business. I wonder how easy that&#8217;s been or if it&#8217;s been surprisingly difficult. If there&#8217;s any challenges come your way and you&#8217;ve thrown your arms in the air and said, oh, wish I&#8217;d never got into this in the first place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:45] Mark Westguard: Yeah, it&#8217;s been a big challenge. And it&#8217;s been very different from a business model that I&#8217;ve been used to. I used to be a web development agency where I would get in the car, go to a meeting, meet a company and sell a website to them. Or I would join an RFP process, you know, and pitch myself against two or three other companies and hopefully win the business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With this, it&#8217;s been very, very difficult. I&#8217;m sure there are some plugins out there that come out that people have jumped on and have been very successful. But building a sustainable subscription-based business is a challenge. We are selling high volume, low price products. Our base price is $59, which doesn&#8217;t go a long way to pay the bills. So you need a lot of those in order to start building a sustainable business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The nice thing about it is when you get to the point where you&#8217;ve got that critical mass and you&#8217;ve got enough people renewing their licenses, and fortunately we have a very good license renewal rate, it starts to become a sustainable business and it starts to, in effect, snowball.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s taken us a good, I&#8217;d say three, four years to get to where I&#8217;d say that we&#8217;re in the clear, we&#8217;re profitable, we&#8217;re doing great. I actually went to a Post Status event, in Oklahoma a few years ago, and I met some other plugin developers there. It&#8217;s actually one of the first times I&#8217;d sat down and had the chance to have a beer with somebody about their WordPress business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it was really interesting sitting and talking to them. And gauging from them where they are in their business. They were saying after year two, three, if you&#8217;re starting to make good profit then, then you&#8217;re on the right path. So it certainly wasn&#8217;t an overnight success, and I wasn&#8217;t expecting that. I expected this to be a much more long slog to get to where we are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And really, I guess it depends on your business model. There are other people in the industry, you know, take for example Newsletter Glue, a newsletter plugin for WordPress. They changed their business model from lots of small customers to much bigger customers and less of them. Which I think is really interesting and quite brave of them to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that seems to be working well for them. I guess it just depends on what plugin you&#8217;re developing and what your price point is and as to how long it&#8217;s going to take. But it&#8217;s certainly taken a lot longer than I expected it to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:57] Nathan Wrigley: But I guess you, having had those chats in the past, you were prepared for that. Let&#8217;s say two year slog. Where it wasn&#8217;t necessarily going to be a case of, okay, I&#8217;ll just toss this into the marketplace and by this time next year it&#8217;ll all be ticking over. There was hard work. Support to be done. We&#8217;ll get to that, but all of these things, continual development and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A takeaway from that would be, yeah, don&#8217;t expect riches quickly. Address the problem of the next couple of years, and I guess in your case, you had other work, other lines of work which you could rely on and develop this at the same time?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:34] Mark Westguard: Yeah. This was very much a career change for me because I was in the agency space building websites. Which I love doing, but the web development space has changed significantly in the past five, six years. And that&#8217;s something I recognized early on. Another reason I wanted to get back into licensing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had the likes of Wix. We had the likes of Squarespace, and to an extent now even WordPress making websites so easy to build. I mean, I&#8217;ve actually built a website for a friend yesterday. I used Kadence and I had something whipped up in an hour. 10 years ago that would&#8217;ve taken us three weeks and a team of five people to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, my industry was dwindling in terms of the revenue that I could create from it, and that&#8217;s why I, you know, I moved to this space. But I think, going back to your point, there&#8217;s a lot of hurdles with building a plugin. You&#8217;ve got to find the good plugin that you want to build. You&#8217;ve got a development period to actually build that product, which can be a considerable investment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then you&#8217;ve got a period of time where you&#8217;ve got to build that customer base up. Where you&#8217;ve not got the income coming in. So for me, I was looking at three, four years before I was breaking even. And I was very fortunate that I had my agency to fall back on. So I was running those in parallel. For some people that may be a need to get some investment. A loan or whatever to get through that period, and actually build the product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:53] Nathan Wrigley: Let&#8217;s get to the pricing piece before we return to the marketing, because I always think this is a curious conversation. On the one hand, you&#8217;ve got a really interesting crowd of people in the free open source software space. A large amount of things which are literally free as in beer. You don&#8217;t pay anything. You can use it how you like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, then you&#8217;ve got obviously people like yourself who are developers and need secure an income and so, there&#8217;s this tension, this conflict between price high to ensure that you can survive and you don&#8217;t need to go through thousands of users in a year. You can do it with a modest amount of sales.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then there&#8217;s this constant pressure to drive down prices and make licensing as cheap as possible. A, because everybody likes things that are as cheap as possible, but also you&#8217;re in competition with other people and that slightly skewed marketplace, which free open source software, like WordPress, has. There&#8217;s definitely a little bit of tension in pricing created there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How did you decide on the pricing? You know, did you have that pang of, okay, I&#8217;ve got to go in low because that&#8217;s what the market can take. I&#8217;ve got price against what all of these other plugins are doing. I&#8217;m curious about how you make those decisions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:11] Mark Westguard: Looking at competitors in the space was a big part of that. Looking at what they were pricing themselves at. Because at the end of the day, somebody looking for a form plugin is maybe going to shop around at the, maybe the top four or five that they find online, right? And if my price was way over the others, they would&#8217;ve just chosen one of the other companies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back then, it was harder for me to differentiate myself against those other plugin companies. That&#8217;s changed over time. I&#8217;ve really found a niche more in the kind of enterprise, developer level, form development. That price sensitivity, I saw it in Facebook groups, in even tweets and things like that. People saying, well, this is, you know, even $10 more than the other customer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s a very price sensitive area, in all of the plugins that are out there. You&#8217;ll find that they&#8217;re very, they all have very similar prices. I am told constantly that I am too cheap, and that I should put my prices up. But I feel like I found a sweet spot and I&#8217;m happy with it right now. So I don&#8217;t really want to rock that boat and change things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other thing to consider is what is your pricing model? There&#8217;s a lot of talk around lifetime deals and annual subscriptions, and I have stuck adamantly with annual subscriptions because I wanted to build a sustainable business. And I&#8217;ve seen far too many plugins, some of them fail, because of offering lifetime deals.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;ve got a critical mass of lifetime deal customers, and then there&#8217;s no additional income coming in. They&#8217;ve got to constantly find new customers to stay alive. Whereas having the annual subscription, that enables me to reinvest that money in the business. Enables me to continue providing good support to those customers on an ongoing basis. And it builds a firmer business. You&#8217;ve got that annual recurring payments coming in, which helps keep the business afloat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah, it was a combination of getting the pricing right, and also getting the actual business model correct. And also the products that you offer. So we have three different versions. We have a personal, which is $59, all the way up to an agency, which gives you everything for 249 currently. And getting those prices right across those different product levels was important too. But I think we&#8217;ve got a pretty good sweet spot now, and I&#8217;ve got no plans to rock the boat.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:25] Nathan Wrigley: But it was a journey. You&#8217;ve arrived at this model over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:30] Mark Westguard: Yeah, even the naming of the product types was a challenge as well. You know, what do we called it? And we decided with agency in the end, that seemed to fit quite nicely with the customers that we were working with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:42] Nathan Wrigley: Given the market that you&#8217;re selling into, and we talked about it just moments ago in terms of the pricing and, I don&#8217;t really know how to describe this, but the community that gathers around open source software, I think there is a slight difference to that community. And obviously WordPress is just dominated by that flavour</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Coming from commercial, enterprise clients, that kind of thing. I&#8217;m just wondering if your marketing had to shift. If there&#8217;s any sort of subtle difference or advice that you would give to anybody? Do you go in for the hard sell? Do you go big on Black Friday? Do you modify your language in a certain way that seems to be appealing to the WordPress community? It&#8217;s hard to encapsulate what that question means, but I hope you&#8217;re getting a flavour of what I&#8217;m trying to say.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:24] Mark Westguard: It was interesting when we did our first WordCamp that in order to be at WordCamp, we weren&#8217;t allowed to say that we were the best form plugin out there, or that we were the ultimate form plugin out there. There&#8217;s always a tendency with businesses to say that isn&#8217;t there? To say, yeah, we&#8217;re the best.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I usually, if I ever see that, I&#8217;m like, okay, well then you&#8217;re not the best. But, that was interesting to me. We actually changed our slogan to just say, build better forms, rather than the best form plugin out there. That started me on a journey with WordPress in terms of being very careful about what we said as a product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it also started me on the journey, obviously with WordCamps, about being very respectful of the WordPress industry. Being very respectful of the WordPress community, and finding out very soon on that they don&#8217;t like being told that you are the best product. They want to hear that from respected names in the industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They want to hear that from other users that are in the community, or people that they work with. So I found that the best way for us to grow was genuinely to do two things. Build a good product, that worked well and did better than other products. And secondly, offering exceptional support. And that&#8217;s something that we&#8217;ve really, really focused on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, support for us is our number one focus. And good support results in good word of mouth about your product. It results in good reviews. And it results in people wanting to talk about your product, and spreading the word about the product in the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That in itself has made the process of getting the name of WS Form out there, a much longer process. But I feel that at the end of it, we&#8217;ve got a stronger brand name out there and we&#8217;ve got a stronger product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:14] Nathan Wrigley: You mentioned there good support, and obviously if I&#8217;m a purchaser of a plugin, nobody thinks that&#8217;s a bad idea. So on my side, customer, good support, great. On your side, supplier, good support, well, presumably that is a lot of hard work. It would be interesting to explore that message for people who may be wanting to launch a plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is support a question of, you know, occasionally logging into your email and dispatching a few emails once or twice a week. Or is it more than that? I&#8217;m guessing that support is essentially, well, I&#8217;m going to make up a figure. Half time might be spent on it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:52] Mark Westguard: If you are building any type of plugin, any kind of significant plugin in WordPress. Know that in about two, three years, you&#8217;re going to be running a support business. That&#8217;s a very big primary function of what you&#8217;re doing. So I think you&#8217;re right. We&#8217;re probably about half the time developing the product, and probably half of the resources goes towards supporting the product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are not providing good support, I personally believe we provide exceptional support. We bend over backwards for customers to really try and help them out. We very much steer our products based upon the support that we&#8217;ve received from people and feedback that we get from customers. It&#8217;s a critical part of the business and, yes, ongoing development is a very important part of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Every time you develop something else for your product, it&#8217;s something else you&#8217;ve got to support. So you&#8217;re constantly improving the product and causing more support for yourself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s important as a plugin developer to ensure that you provide as much front end content as possible to cut down those support requests, and make it easier for the customer to find what they want. So, for example, we have an extensive knowledge base. We also analyze what people type in when they&#8217;re making a support request to us, and we will fire back suggested articles back to them, to help them get to the information they want without having to raise a support ticket and wait for us to reply.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, support is a critical part of the business, and will be a large part of what you do if you are in a similar space to what we are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:21] Nathan Wrigley: I suppose in a sense, if you are running a subscription business, an annual subscription business, where you are hoping that people when the renewal for the license comes up, you&#8217;re hoping that they happily walk through that process and, sign up for another year. So the support in a sense is about just maintaining that, isn&#8217;t it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you secure the initial sale and then the support is lousy. You really are not giving yourself a fighting chance on next year&#8217;s set of scheduled payments.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:51] Mark Westguard: Yeah. I always remember when I was at university and I did a year out in industry, and they had something written on the wall, and it&#8217;s always stuck with me. And it just said, easy to do business with, was one of their terms that they&#8217;d like to use with their staff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that stuck with me. And I think if you are easy to do business with, which means providing good support, providing a good product. These people will renew, and they will continue to use you. I can say hand on heart, when we lose a customer, it is usually because, maybe an agency is no longer working with a customer anymore. Or they&#8217;ve had a website redesign or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don&#8217;t have people saying, don&#8217;t like the product, don&#8217;t like your support. And that is testament to the hard work that we&#8217;ve put in to building the product. And, you know, having the passion to provide that good customer service. So I think yeah, you know, in answer to your point, having that good customer service will absolutely bring people back, and keep them using your product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:44] Nathan Wrigley: Developing the plugin itself, that&#8217;s on your schedule, isn&#8217;t it? You can decide, right, I&#8217;m going to allocate this amount of time. But the support stuff, that just comes in when it comes in. You&#8217;ve got no control over that. I am genuinely curious what that does to your work-life balance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ve got a support team, or if you handle all of that yourself. But how that is for you. Because it sounds like a large part of this podcast is really trying to speak to people who may be wanting to go into this, and this seems like a good rabbit hole to go down. It sounds like that&#8217;s a big burden, right? And you&#8217;ve got to be available during holiday time, weekends, all sorts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:21] Mark Westguard: Yeah, I think my personality doesn&#8217;t help either. If I see a support ticket, I want to help that person as quickly as I can. It&#8217;s weird, some days you can maybe get two support tickets. Other days there could be a huge flurry of 20, 30 tickets. There&#8217;s no average that happens every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when you get that big flurry, I like to clear our support queue every day. And that can sometimes mean late nights to get that. And being a small business, that&#8217;s what you do. You&#8217;ll have those late nights of helping people out with stuff, particularly if something maybe is a bug in the software that you really want to get fixed and make sure that that doesn&#8217;t affect anybody else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah, some days can be quiet. It&#8217;s funny because I have a lot of European customers. By the time I wake up in the US I can usually gauge how busy the day&#8217;s going to be, based upon the number of support tickets that I&#8217;ve got. But fortunately the vast majority of the tickets that we get are, how do I do this? And I can point them in the direction of a knowledge base article that we have. So those are easy to fix.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I find that we are getting one or two of the same question, I will write a knowledge base article and refer them to that, in the hope that that will then cut down that particular question in the future as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, support and building knowledge bases or help documentation is a massive undertaking. It&#8217;s taken a lot of time to get all that content put together and built. And that&#8217;s another thing that plugin developers should certainly take into account is, as well as building your product you&#8217;ve got to document it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even on the small plugin, you know, some of these. WS Forms are huge plugin. It is tens of thousands of lines of code. There are much simpler plugins out there. But even though smaller plugins need maybe a good page documentation to make sure people understand how to use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:05] Nathan Wrigley: You have got a lite version in the WordPress repository. So just to be clear, for anybody who&#8217;s listening to this podcast. There&#8217;s a paid version. You can go to Mark&#8217;s website, we&#8217;ll link in the show notes, but you can also go and download a free version. I&#8217;m always curious as to how you make the decision of what to, well, I&#8217;m going to say strip out. Maybe that&#8217;s completely the wrong way around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe it&#8217;s more, okay, this is what we&#8217;re going to build for the repository and then we&#8217;ll add on other things. But forgive my language there. How do you come to decide that, okay, this is free. This is not free. What is the process that&#8217;s going on there? Because obviously you want to, in some way entice people. But you don&#8217;t want to make free version utterly useless otherwise, well, nobody&#8217;s ever going to dream of heading in the pro direction.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:56] Mark Westguard: Yeah, and some plugin developers do make their plugins almost useless, so that you have to pay for the pro edition. We actually wanted to provide a lite edition that was fully usable. So for example, there are some plugins out there that won&#8217;t actually store the submissions so that you can view them in the WordPress admin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I thought, well, that&#8217;s a bit mean. It&#8217;s a form plugin. You need to be able to see your submissions and have them as a backup in the database. So we gave a little bit back. We gave back a little bit more than maybe some of the other form plugins do, really to contribute again to the community. To enable people to use the product for free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you can build a perfectly usable contact us form, or inquiry form, using our lite edition. And then it was really more of the technical, more advanced features, that we cut out. So things like conditional logic, e-commerce. Some of the field types that were a little bit more advanced, like Google address and things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Obviously we want people to upgrade to the pro edition because that&#8217;s how we pay the bills. But we wanted the lite edition to be usable and useful to a lot of people that just want to use a free product. So, you know, that&#8217;s another contribution that we give back. We don&#8217;t throw up huge admin notices that say, hey, upgrade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;ve got very, very subtle things in the product that encourage people to upgrade. So we&#8217;ve tried not to be, you know, there&#8217;s a lot of plugins out there, a little bit over the top on the notifications on the admin panel. So we&#8217;ve tried to cut that down and be a bit more reasonable. We hope that people enjoy using the lite edition for that reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:27] Nathan Wrigley: Although this isn&#8217;t directly related to the plugin necessarily. AI at the minute is all the hotness. And I did notice that you had taken the time to build an integration with OpenAI for your form plugin. And I&#8217;m curious, what was the thinking there? Because when I approach a form, I&#8217;m always thinking, okay, there&#8217;s blank fields. I just them out and click return, and obviously wait for a response to come back and so on. What thing does OpenAI or AI in general bring to a form?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:59] Mark Westguard: Two things for us. So, first of all, from a purely commercial side of it, we like to integrate in with new systems because it opens up a new audience for us. And also OpenAI had a lot of marketing going on in the industry. People were very interested in it. I was as well, I was curious about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I researched OpenAI and I found out that they have a moderation endpoint in their API, which means I can send it some content and it will tell me whether or not that content has bad language in it or bad words, or is it violent content or whatever. And I thought, hey, wouldn&#8217;t that be great for WordPress spam protection?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I looked into it more and I was able to integrate in that moderation piece, so that when a form is submitted, it analyzes what the person&#8217;s typed in. If there&#8217;s anything to do with violence or whatever in there, it will then reject that form submission. Then I looked at the other endpoints such as the image generator. So people may be familiar with that, with DALL-E. Where you can type in, you know, make a boat floating on the moon, or whatever crazy thing you want to create an image about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I was able to pull that into a file upload field, and I thought, well, that&#8217;ll be great for creating an avatar for a new user or an image for a blog. So that got incorporated. And then I thought, well look, all these other endpoints that OpenAI offer or actually have a use case, on a form. So we use the, what they call a completion, which is where you type in a question and it will then give you a response.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That has actually been very useful for our customers that have a supporting environment. You can actually tell OpenAI what your business is, where your support page is, et cetera, and it will actually respond almost as if they&#8217;re an employee of the company. And we&#8217;ve had some people using that application. So, after researching it, found it had quite a lot of application in the form industry.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s why we had the OpenAI integration. And we&#8217;ve just launched it with GPT-4. Which at the time is the latest model that they&#8217;ve released. So, it&#8217;s actually been a very popular feature. And that add-on incidentally is free of charge whilst OpenAI is still effectively in beta. We&#8217;ve got that add-on free of charge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:40:12] Nathan Wrigley: Yeah, it&#8217;s really curious. I&#8217;m fascinated by the whole AI debate. This is not necessarily related to the whole AI debate, but ever since the web came around, essentially we&#8217;ve been presenting pictures and words to people, and the only way to really respond to that is through some kind of form interface. That&#8217;s what you&#8217;ve got.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But a few years ago, along come these devices which sit in the home, which you can talk to. And I just wondered what, it&#8217;s a really bizarre question. A bit of a random question. I wondered what your thoughts are about that kind of technology. Getting into the whole, speaking to the internet instead of filling out forms and, perhaps even putting on goggles and all of that kind of stuff. Whether or not you feel that this is something that you need to be mindful of. Do you have any sense that the world is moving more towards voice?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel that, certainly from my perspective, I found that to be an interesting technology for a period of time, and now the interest in that has completely waned and those voice devices in my home really only get used for starting and stopping songs, that kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:19] Mark Westguard: It&#8217;s funny isn&#8217;t it? Because computers, as we know it, have been around for, what, 50, 60 years now. A keyboard and a computer. And I&#8217;ve still got a keyboard in front of me. I still like typing on a keyboard. I don&#8217;t like talking to computers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My children are very different. They like talking to computers. I think it&#8217;s a generation thing to a certain degree. To your point about keeping up with this technology. That&#8217;s very much another reason why we had the OpenAI add-on. I wanted to be familiar with that technology. It is changing the way that we are doing things. People are writing code with it now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re generating images with it. Like it or hate it, it&#8217;s changing the way that we&#8217;re doing things. It&#8217;s being incorporated into products. We are actually working on another AI integration into WS Form, which would almost enable you to develop a form based upon what you type in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They have a code model for OpenAI, and we&#8217;ve been able to take a prompt and actually build a form from what you&#8217;ve typed in. So you can say, build me a form for a doctor&#8217;s office for booking an appointment, and it will build a form for you. So something that we&#8217;ve got to be on top of and we&#8217;ve got to adapt and work around it and take advantage of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:39] Nathan Wrigley: That&#8217;s so fascinating because in a way it doesn&#8217;t in any way cut out the need for a form solution. It merely creates that templating system. So I know that your form solution, for example, when you create a form, you&#8217;ve got loads of different templates for different scenarios, and you can click on a button and so that job&#8217;s done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In this case, you would be able to fill that out by just writing in plain text. So, I would like a form with three fields. It&#8217;s for my kid&#8217;s birthday party. And it&#8217;s highly unlikely that you&#8217;ll have got a template for whatever scenario I can contrive. But this potentially purports to do that and create a custom form based upon what you tell it. That&#8217;s fascinating.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:43:19] Mark Westguard: At least a foundation for that. And then on the other side of it, the OpenAI add-on that we have can turn your form into an interactive component where they get an immediate response. And that&#8217;s done through prompt engineering with OpenAI. So prompt engineering is where behind the scenes you are giving OpenAI a little bit more context about the question, and then incorporating the question from the user into that particular prompt that you&#8217;re sending to them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that kind of comes back to that customer support aspect I was talking about earlier on. So I can configure it, and if they ask a question, it can be asked as if it&#8217;s your company. So just for an a very quick example, you could say, hey, I am hosting company X, and then the customer may ask, please tell me what your hosting packages are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>OpenAI will then use its knowledge of your business to respond to that and give you a list of the packages they have, directly in that form. Rather than them having to submit the form and wait for a response from a human. It can be used very much to compliment existing forms that you&#8217;ve got on your website, to make them more user friendly, and to give customers a quicker response. And if we didn&#8217;t have that OpenAI component, we would not be on that bandwagon. So I&#8217;m glad that we have that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:34] Nathan Wrigley: So it&#8217;s almost like a chatbot creation. Whereas at the moment chatbots are very much the realms of SaaS, you are saying that some of this technology can be pulled in. So obviously there is a SaaS side if you like, and it&#8217;s OpenAI. But you can bind that to a form and the form can then become much more interactive than it currently could ever be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:44:55] Mark Westguard: Correct. Yeah. It&#8217;s funny because people have said to us, can we use your form for a chat interface? This opens that up. This enables it to be a chat. Granted it&#8217;s an AI response, but tuned properly it can be very effective. It&#8217;s quite scary what you can get back from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:12] Nathan Wrigley: The future is either bright or scary, depending on which side of the fence you sit there. Mark, we&#8217;ve probably used up the time that we&#8217;ve got available, so just before we pass it over to the audience. I&#8217;d like you to, to tell us where you can be found. That could be a social media platform or your website address. Whatever you like. Just tell us where we can find you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:32] Mark Westguard: Yeah, so the main website is wsform.com. You can find me on Twitter. I am at Westguard, that&#8217;s w e s t g u a r d. And for WS Form, it is w s _ f o r m.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:46] Nathan Wrigley: Somebody had WS Form. Did they?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:48] Mark Westguard: They did and they&#8217;ve done nothing with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:51] Nathan Wrigley: Well, Mark an absolute pleasure chatting to you. Thanks for talking to us about your plugin development journey, and growing your business, and forms in general. I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:00] Mark Westguard: Yeah. Well, thank you for having me on the show. I appreciate it.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/westguard\">Mark Westguard</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mark is an agency owner and the developer behind the WS Form plugin, and he’s on the podcast to chart his journey in the WordPress space and the different ways he’s explored to grow the reach of the plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First up, we talk about why Mark started to use WordPress. As you’ll hear, he already had a successful agency, but he could see that the path to profitability was becoming harder each year. WordPress plugins offered the chance of recurring revenue, which was appealing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Users of WordPress will know that there are many form solutions. Both free and paid plugins are available and can handle almost any scenario you might imagine. We get into what made Mark pick this as an area to invest in. Surely it would have been easier to work on something brand new? Mark does not think so. He could see gaps in the market, and built his solution to cater to those. This involved plenty of market research and analysis of where to put his development efforts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We then move onto the subject of turning a well-developed plugin into a viable business. It’s one thing to build a product, but if you’re going to make it commercial, much of the work will revolve around ensuring that the world knows about it. Marketing is a relentless enterprise and one that you should not ignore or underestimate. This might mean getting yourself out into the community to meet with other WordPressers, appearing on podcasts, or sponsoring WordPress events. There’s no perfect answer. Just run with what works and try out new things all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that comes support. Mark’s pretty clear, your product will succeed or fail based upon how you handle support requests. He thinks that the development of a plugin inevitably leads to support tickets, and this needs to be factored in right from the start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also get into the subject of pricing, and what Mark felt was the right place to pitch his plugin. Is the WordPress ecosystem guilty of expecting a lot from plugins at prices which are realistic? How much of the functionality, if any, should be given away in a free version, and how did he decide which features to charge for?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Towards the end of the podcast, we stray into the plugin’s use of AI, and how Mark was an early mover in this area. What can be done with forms and AI, and does he see AI as a technology which is going to grow in the future?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 class=\"wp-block-heading\">Useful links.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/ws-form/\">WS Form LITE</a> on the WordPress repo</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://wsform.com\">WS Form</a> website</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://oauth.net\">OAuth</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.bigorangeheart.org\">Big Orange Heart</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://givewp.com\">GiveWP</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://newsletterglue.com\">Newsletter Glue</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.kadencewp.com\">KadenceWP</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://openai.com\">OpenAI</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://openai.com/research/dall-e\">DALL-E</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://openai.com/product/gpt-4\">GPT-4</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ws_form\">WS Form Twitter</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 10 May 2023 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:45;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:122:\"WPTavern: WordPress Community Team Evolves WordCamp Format to Promote Adoption, Training, and Networking for Professionals\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=144827\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:131:\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-community-team-evolves-wordcamp-format-to-promote-adoption-training-and-networking-for-professionals\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6127:\"<p>WordPress&#8217; Community Team hailed a new era of WordCamps in its recent <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2023/05/08/the-next-generation-of-wordcamps/\">announcement</a> outlining a significant shift in the purpose for the events. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past, WordCamps have had a mostly predictable format of presenting inspirational talks on exciting things people are doing with WordPress, business topics, and the latest trends, with short networking opportunities and a contributor day appended to the event. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Connection, inspiration, and contribution are undeniably important to WordPressers,&#8221; Automattic-sponsored WordPress community organizer Angela Jin said. &#8220;However, as events have returned, communities see that people are much more selective about what events they attend and want to know what they will gain by participating.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After the pandemic, the number of WordCamps dwindled to a fraction of what they had been, as different areas of the world grappled with their own unique public health situations. The Community Team had loosened some of the requirements for WordCamps in order to foster a more welcoming environment for people to want to host in-person events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In an effort to modernize these gatherings moving forward, the team has proposed the following update to the purpose of WordPress events:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>WordPress events spark innovation and adoption by way of accessible training and networking for users, builders, designers, and extenders. We celebrate community by accelerating 21st-century skills, professional opportunities, and partnerships for WordPressers of today and tomorrow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Jin said she hopes a &#8220;period of innovation and experimentation will follow this critical shift in the purpose of our events&#8221; where events will be curated for more narrow audiences and have a focus on a specific type of content or topic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>This shift also opens the door for more varied event formats, such as workshops, unconferences, job fairs, and pure networking events &#8211; which would have definitively been outside the traditional WordCamps of old and not officially supported by the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jin emphasized that WordPress will continue encouraging local meetups. Currently planned WordCamps (there are currently 14 on the <a href=\"https://central.wordcamp.org/schedule/\">schedule</a> for 2023) can continue as before but new WordCamp applicants will be encouraged to experiment with new formats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Flagships (<a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2023/\">WordCamp US</a>, <a href=\"https://europe.wordcamp.org/2023/\">WordCamp Europe</a>, <a href=\"https://asia.wordcamp.org/2024/\">WordCamp Asia</a>): These will remain our largest, broadest event that fully capitalizes on the energy of a large crowd,&#8221; Jin said. &#8220;They will be the place to highlight the latest, greatest, and coolest in WordPress and where we are going.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p> Reactions to the change in the purpose of WordCamp have been mostly positive but the community has some questions about how it will work. David Bisset, who helped run WordCamp Miami for over a decade, asks how this will impact smaller communities:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>I certainly would love to see more formats being tried, more standout content, etc. However, I’m trying to view this from a local and smaller WordCamp organizer mindset – what if I have a varied community and therefore a varied audience? Will having a particular audience in mind in setting content and promoting local WordCamps unknowingly not attract a more diverse audience? Many people come to conferences and WordCamps for certain talks and speakers and stay around for the rest.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress plugin developer David McCan <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/2023/05/08/the-next-generation-of-wordcamps/#comment-30874\">commented</a> that the new purpose statement reads more like educating and preparing a workforce in contrast to how WordCamps previously leaned towards empowering volunteers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Participants in the discussion are heavily in favor of giving more freedom to event organizers, but many have had irreplaceable experiences at WordCamps in their current format that they are reluctant to see it go. WordPress developer and contributor Ross Wintle commented that he hoped the change in purpose would not diminish the diversity at WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;While I think there’s some value in focussing on an audience, please don’t throw out the current WordCamps,&#8221; Wintle said. &#8220;I genuinely believe that one of the best things about these events is that I get to experience the diversity of the WordPress community and see the many, many different ways that WordPress is used, extended and developed for, and I get to meet the many, many talented people from across the spectrum of contribution who possess ideas, skills and experiences that I do not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I’ve met so many amazing people who have different roles in WordPress, and I think the value of this is far higher than sitting in my bubble with the people that do the same things as me.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Marketing contributor Sé Reed asked Jin what team meeting, GitHub issue, or other documented discussion was available to follow the decision-making process for this major change to WordCamps, as no discussions were linked in the announcement. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;To my mind, this kind of change (affecting the entire WordPress community and apparently effective immediately) is something that would make sense to discuss at the Community Summit,&#8221; Reed said. &#8220;As that ship has sailed, I’d like to at least see the discussion that led to it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jin has not yet responded to these questions but said in the announcement that as event organizers experiment with different formats for WordCamps, &#8220;the community team can reevaluate our full events program and how events coexist happily.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 10 May 2023 01:55:21 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:46;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:75:\"WordPress Foundation: Kim Parsell Memorial Scholarship for WordCamp US 2023\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/?p=456908\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"https://wordpressfoundation.org/news/2023/kim-parsell-memorial-scholarship-for-wordcamp-us-2023/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:1530:\"<p>The WordPress Foundation will once again offer the Kim Parsell Memorial Scholarship for travel to <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2023/\">WordCamp US 2023</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At each in-person WordCamp US, the WordPress Foundation honors Kim’s commitment and valuable contributions to the WordPress open source project.

AI-powered website creation could even become a threat to its existence, more than a competing CMS, if WordPress doesn&#8217;t ensure the platform is easily pluggable for AI-powered extensions. A new <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/05/02/lets-talk-wordpress-core-artificial-intelligence/\">discussion</a> on the Core developer&#8217;s blog asks what WordPress can do to better enable AI innovation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;WordPress Core always seeks to provide a stable foundation for folks to build upon directly and extend as they see fit,&#8221; Automattic-sponsored core contributor Anne McCarthy said. &#8220;Even if a new technology is not actually included in Core, the project aims to enable innovation and progress through extension (plugins, themes, etc.) wherever possible and sensible.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>McCarthy shared a video of what it might look like to have AI integrated into Gutenberg&#8217;s experimental command center to build out pages based on AI-suggested designs. She asked three questions of contributors: </p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>How would you want to see Core updated so it can be extended in ways accessible to AI technologies?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>For those&nbsp; building, or trying to build, with AI today, how does Core currently enable or hinder this effort?</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Are there any concerns that you think the community should be aware of as this space is explored?</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress co-founder Matt Mullenweg is optimistic about the prospect of further integrating AI into open source development.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;In 2015 I told you to learn Javascript deeply,&#8221; Mullenweg <a href=\"https://poststatus.slack.com/archives/CHNM7Q7T8/p1680473547032499\">said</a> last month in the Post Status Slack. &#8220;I don&#8217;t have a catchy phrase yet, but my message for 2023 will be to spend as much time leveraging AI as possible. The boosts to productivity and capability are <em>amazing</em>. This is not a web3/crypto/widgets hype cycle. It&#8217;s real.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mullenweg also encouraged WordPress professionals to consider how AI and open source can work together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Open source and AI are the two mega-trends of the next 30 years,&#8221; he said. &#8220;They complement each other, and you should think deeply about how. ChatGPT can&#8217;t ready Shopify&#8217;s code.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>StellarWP-sponsored contributor Matt Cromwell <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/05/02/lets-talk-wordpress-core-artificial-intelligence/#comment-44809\">commented</a> on the latest core discussion, suggesting that AI innovation is better left to plugin developers. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;All AI options currently require integration with a 3rd party system, some sort of pricing and authentication, this feels to me to clearly be plugin territory,&#8221; Cromwell said.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The other concern here is that the current Core roadmap is very full. At what cost would the project chase an AI integration? At the expense of multi-editing collaboration features? At the expense of multi-lingual features? I find it hard to imagine pursuing the current roadmap with excellence and stability AND adding a huge AI integration as well.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bluehost-sponsored contributor Jonathan Desrosiers, one of the reviewers of the post, clarified that the intention was to &#8220;fuel discussion around what AI looks like in the WordPress ecosystem and how that may be blocked currently.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;As you said, the roadmap is definitely full and adding new things should not be done unless there are extremely compelling reasons,&#8221; Desrosiers said. &#8220;But, if there are small “paper cut” changes that can be made in Core (new filter or action hooks, etc.) to allow plugins to better experiment and flesh out AI integrations in the WordPress world, I think that we certainly should consider these.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cromwell suggested WordPress could add a settings panel for integrating various API&#8217;s, such as payment gateways and OpenAI API keys, to prevent conflicts and streamline API usage across multiple plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Rob Glidden proposed that contributors consider the possibility of having AI chatbots as a user type for the future collaboration workflow inside WordPress:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>I would suggest looking at AI chatbots as (“just another”) user type in the upcoming Phase 3 of collaboration/workflow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I for one want an AI chatbot on my multiuser collaboration team in a phase 3 WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the multiuser collaborative workflows already described in “<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2023/03/24/phase-3-collaboration/\">Phase 3 Collaboration</a>” it seems like basically the same infrastructure should work for both human users and AI “users”.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Indeed, it is not a huge stretch in reading that document to think of “users”, “collaborators”, and “creators” as also being bot-ish users, assigned and performing tasks within a workflow.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>CodeWP-sponsored contributor James LePage echoed Cromwell&#8217;s concerns that focusing too much on integrating AI might make WordPress less competitive on the features that have already been identified for Gutenberg&#8217;s Phase 3 roadmap:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>As some others said here, as a WP&nbsp;<em>user</em>, I’d much prefer a really strong focus on the existing Phase 3 roadmap items as I think it would make our CMS a lot more valuable and competitive to other tools out there, as opposed to integrating AI somehow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One other thing is that there aren’t really any standards here. There are large players, but they keep changing the way their AI works, and probably will continue to do so. We’d be trying to hit a moving target.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>As much as WordPress contributors are spread thin across the project&#8217;s current Gutenberg roadmap of goals and improvements, you don&#8217;t get to choose when new technology is bearing down on your industry, forcing you to act or become obsolete. The WordPress community has built a robust plugin ecosystem, but leaving it all to third-party integrations may not be enough to keep the software relevant in the coming years. Ensuring that WordPress is compatible with the future of AI-powered innovation is critical if contributors want the platform to continue to be the best CMS and website builder available on the web.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 08 May 2023 21:52:07 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:49;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"WordPress.org blog: WP Briefing: Episode 55: Happy Anniversary, WordPress!\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?post_type=podcast&p=14949\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2023/05/episode-55-happy-anniversary-wordpress/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15023:\"<p>Join WordPress Executive Director Josepha Haden Chomphosy in the 55th episode of the WordPress Briefing as she looks back at the 20 years of WordPress and how the open source community made WordPress what it is today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em><strong>Have a question you’d like answered?

Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In case you hadn&#8217;t heard yet. WordPress is celebrating its 20th anniversary on May 27th.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are a lot of celebrations and parties happening all across the world, hopefully with cake, because we all know that a party without cake is just a meeting and no one wants a year-long meeting about how old you are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:59]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But if you&#8217;ve not yet joined the celebrations, there&#8217;s still time to share your favorite WordPress merch, your favorite WordCamp memory, host a whole dang party if you want to, or share a video to post on wp20.wordpress.net. I&#8217;ve got links to everything you need in the show notes. So if you haven&#8217;t done it yet, you can do that while you listen to today&#8217;s episode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:14]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve got links to everything you need in the show notes. So if you haven&#8217;t done it yet, you can do that while you listen to today&#8217;s episode.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:22]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today, WordPress is the leading CMS in the market. And according to W3Tech&#8217;s it powers 43% of the web. And that&#8217;s like 35% of the top 10,000 sites that are built using this software. And sometimes, that&#8217;s as a website, sometimes as a framework, but always as a way for people and businesses to find a space on the web to call their own.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:45]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021. The first-ever study on the WordPress ecosystem gave us an idea of just how large our ecosystem is. We already kind of had a sense that millions of people make a living through WordPress because we know that we are supporting small business owners and freelancers all the way out to agencies and content creators.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:06]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But according to that study, WordPress at the time was powering 82 million websites and enabled an estimated economy of $597 billion. The success of an economy like this and various other alternative economies hinges on the success of invisible open source software that powers the web, just like WordPress, that has a tonne of growth and a lot of wins since that first Cafe Log fork way back in 2003.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:37]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And WordPress could just say pencils down, everybody. Good job, team, and just kind of watch what comes next. But I&#8217;ve never met a word processor, emboldened as we are by our belief in open source freedoms, who stepped away from a challenge worth facing the recognition that everyone should have those freedoms whether they know they exist or not. Because I know that no one cares as much about open source freedoms as open source maintainers. But the recognition that everyone has the right to them anyway is built into the foundations of what WordPress is and who WordPress is.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:13]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are big plans for WordPress future, many of which are grounded in the promise of a new block editor within WordPress that aims to lower the barriers to entry for people at any point in their learning curve. So let&#8217;s take a look at what this means for WordPress, the software, and follow up about what it means for the WordPress community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&nbsp;[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:31]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Firstly, the software right at the end of 2018, the Gutenberg editor was merged into WordPress Core. And it&#8217;s subverted the way that people had always managed their content. It brought with it this new concept of site building that focused on blocks as the primary mode of creation. It was modular and required very little code knowledge.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:53]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Arguably also very little skill with design. Although if you&#8217;ve ever seen me tried to design something with blocks, you will know it takes some skill. But still, the ultimate goal was to make those fundamental user interactions of managing the block and apply them in any place you could manage your site using WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:53]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you think about the possibility to create media-rich content without having to work with shortcode, without having to know HTML workarounds, it opens the opportunity for many of us in the WordPress community to own our digital presence. In case it wasn&#8217;t already clear, this, my friends, is an audacious project, and it&#8217;s even more so if you remember that we have this existing and massive ecosystem that is enabled and empowered by our software.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:42]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And as we look forward to the third phase of the Gutenberg Project, collaborative editing inside a WordPress installation will soon be a reality, which if you are like me and you never work on a website alone, you&#8217;re probably just dying to have. I say all this not to toot the horn have WordPress or belabor our success but rather to emphasize the importance of what I&#8217;m going to say next, which is how this CMS got to where it is, namely through the work of the community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:12]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has survived, and I would dare to say thrived through decades of constant economic, cultural, and technological shifts. And I believe that the thing that keeps us innovating fast enough to stay relevant but slow enough to be ethical, is how the community actively engages with the open source project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:32]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We know that our strength is directly tied to the resilience of our contributors. And we know that the software we ship is shaped by the people who are willing to tell us what they love, what they hate, and what they hope to see. When the WordPress project started, we mainly had code contributions as a way to give back, but over time, the project has grown to include contributions to learning, community building, and translations, among other things, but all of that exists alongside the CMS-focused contributions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:03]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because WordPress as an organization understands that it is an integral part of an ecosystem of 1000s of global companies and millions of individual people who are building careers, starting businesses, learning new skills, and becoming part of something meaningful. I know that I talk just all the time about the greatness of WordPress as a software and community, which makes sense.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:29]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really do love the work I do with you all. But I am equally in awe of this open-hearted journey of disruption that WordPress represents as an open source project. WordPress and its community is part of a long line of disruptors; blogs made publishing available to everyone, which maybe doesn&#8217;t sound like a big deal right now because you&#8217;ve been around blogging forever.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:51]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ve been able to just put your thoughts on the internet with almost no effort for as long as you have known the internet existed, but WordPress, at the time, was and honestly remains the low code open source CMS of choice. It has been for years. And so, let me backtrack you through the 10,000-foot milestones of our journey here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:14]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Gutenberg has been around since 2013. It&#8217;s 10 years. I know, don&#8217;t get scared, we&#8217;re celebrating 20 years. So it&#8217;s been around for half of our time as a concept. Open source as a concept was formalized in the 1980s. Though it definitely has been around longer than that as a concept and a way of working.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:34]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And this low-code, no-code movement that we hear about from time to time that has been around since the 1970s, and just because we first became aware of it in the 1970s doesn&#8217;t mean that that&#8217;s when it actually first was discussed or thought about or used. Which means that you are in this moment, decades deep into projects that changed our entire understanding of the web.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:59]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So grab a slice of cake, and raise a glass to 20 great years of WordPress, and I am going to raise a glass to 20 more years of continuing our journey together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:17]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us effervescently to the small list of big things. Yeah, I said effervescently.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:24]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are a lot of things happening in the WordPress project over the next couple of weeks. There is a lot of testing going on. There are a lot of releases that are getting underway. There are events and things. So here&#8217;s my rundown of stuff you should take a look at.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:38]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So firstly, there is a post out about performance improvements from 6.2. That is just inviting an open discussion so that we can get more of those improvements in better shape to get into the 6.3 release. And speaking of the 6.3 release that is coming, just last week, we announced the release squad that we have.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:58]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It is an extra heavy release squad because we also are working toward the 6.4 release just at the same time. So there&#8217;s the folks who are running the 6.3 release, and they have committed to working openly and in public channels as much as possible so that the 6.4 folks have a chance to really take a look at what goes into a release, the questions that we ask, the philosophies we believe in, and then that 6.4 release oil pick up probably, my guess is August-ish, mid-August or so.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:32]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That 6.4 release is specifically going to be made up entirely of diverse genders. People that we historically see are underrepresented in technology, but as always, we accept contributions from everyone for all releases.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:48]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The third thing is that we have WordCamp Europe coming up, that is June 8 and 10th. So a little bit past the two-week mark.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:54]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, there is a final call for volunteers for anyone who wants to be able to help at the event. I personally have always enjoyed doing that kind of volunteer work. It helps you get to know your community even a bit better. And I don&#8217;t know; I&#8217;m just kind of an extroverted people person. So, of course, I always want to volunteer, but that call is still open. And they&#8217;re in the last phases of that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:17]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is also a team or two that needs some help with getting leads for the contributor day that happens leading up to WordCamp. Europe, I know that the testing team needs a lead for the table, and so if you enjoy the process of triaging or testing or helping people get their environment set up, that is a great opportunity.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:37]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the final thing on my small, my big small list of big things is that we have a kind of a review of the currently defined contributor ladder for the Polyglots team. There are a number of posts over the years where we talk about the ways that people move through being a contributor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:57]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that we know about almost all contributor ladders is that there&#8217;s no time requirement between the steps, but in general, it functions like a ladder. So you do have to have, like, rung one. And then, rung two, if you try to skip from rung one to rung three, you will have a lot of difficulty.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:17]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not impossible, but it&#8217;s harder than going 1, 2, 3 In the normal sequential order. And so that&#8217;s a whole discussion that&#8217;s happening over there. There&#8217;s a link to all of these things in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:28]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy,  and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 08 May 2023 14:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Brett McSherry\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:48:\"WpOrg\\Requests\\Utility\\CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:8:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Thu, 25 May 2023 10:06:12 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:8:\"text/xml\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Thu, 25 May 2023 09:45:31 GMT\";s:4:\"vary\";s:15:\"Accept-Encoding\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:16:\"content-encoding\";s:4:\"gzip\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 2\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20211220193300\";}', 'no');
